 abstract = {The Agricultural Ingeneer Dr. Teruo Higa, professor of Horticulture at the University of The Ryukyus in Okinawa, Japan creates a technique in the 80th de- cade related with the use of efficient microorganism. This technology is the basis of the present review aim at providing information about groups of benevolent microorganisms such as: lactic acid bacteria, photo- trophic bacteria, actinomycetes group, yeast group and fungi present in natural ecosystems which are physiologically compatible with each other. Efficient Microorganisms, as a microbial inoculantion, resto- re soil microbiological balance, improve its physical and chemical conditions, increase crop production and protection, preserve natural resources, and ge- nerate a more sustainable agriculture and environ- ment. They can be used in the livestock (cattle, por- ciculture and poultry) for animal husbandry and the increase of productive variables. All this maximizes the efficiency of the systems and the management of excreta and facilities.},

 abstract = {港内水深が一定であることを仮定し，波の回折・反射変形を考慮して港内波高分布を算定する高山法に対し，複雑な海底地形をそのまま入力できるブシネスクモデルでは，港内で生じる屈折・浅水・砕波変形を考慮した港内波高分布を算定することができる．また，実海域への適用を可能にするさまざまな境界処理法を備えたNOWT-PARIでは，港内外の防波堤や岬などの障害物に起因する回折・反射・透過変形に加え，水面波の非線形性・分散性および不規則性・多方向性などもすべて同時に計算されるので，港湾や海岸を対象とした実海域で起こりうる波浪変形をほぼ再現できると考えられる．
ところで，防波堤延伸や消波工設置の効果などを定量評価し，安全で使い易い港湾を計画するための指標として，港内静穏度および荷役稼働率が定義されている．これらの算定には，沖波波浪出現頻度分布をほぼ代表する各入射波を設定した複数の港内波浪変形計算を実施することが必要であるが，計算負荷の小さい高山法はこの要求に適し，かつ水深が一様とみなせる港内の波高分布を比較的精度よく算定できる信頼性と汎用性を有しているため，港湾設計の実務においてこれまで広く用いられてきた．そして，現在の港内静穏度解析法は高山法をベースとして構築されている．すなわち，港内波浪出現頻度分布を算定するために行う波浪変形計算の各ケースでは，入射波高は1mで一定とし，周期および波向の違いによる港内波高比の変化のみが考慮される．これは，港内での屈折・浅水・砕波変形が算定されない高山法による計算結果では，入射波の波高や波形勾配による港内波高比の変化が生じないためである．
ところが近年では，船舶の大型化に伴う大水深バースや航路，泊地の整備，あるいは海域環境に配慮したさんご礁や岩礁等の浅瀬の保全などにより港内地形が複雑化・多様化し，これらを考慮しない従来の港内静穏度解析法では対応しきれない港湾もみられるようになっている．そこで本研究では，このような港湾における波浪変形計算にブシネスクモデルを適用し，かつ入
射波の波高や波形勾配による港内波高比の変化を考慮して，港内の対象岸壁における港内静穏度ならびに荷役稼働率を算定する「高精度港内静穏度解析法」を提案した．
すなわち，透水層を用いた任意反射境界処理法に加え，乱れ生成項に段波によるエネルギー損失を適用した乱流モデルに基づく砕波減衰計算法，ならびに引き波時に海底面が露出することも許容する遡上計算法を備えた最新ブシネスクモデル（NOWT-PARI，Ver5.2）を対象として，２つの具体的な港湾を例に，入射波高を一定とした従来の方法，および波向，周期に加え入射波高をも変化させた本研究の方法によって港内静穏度を算定した．さらに，一定の荷役限界波高を用いる従来法と，船型，周期，波向によって異なる荷役限界波高を用いる標準解析法を適用して荷役稼働率を算定した．これらの算定結果を比較したところ，港口周辺に浅瀬や珊瑚礁が広がる港湾では，とくに港内での砕波変形の影響により，従来の方法に比べ高い静穏度（=従来法による荷役稼働率）および荷役稼働率が算定される傾向にあることが明らかとなった．ただし，低潮位時には浅水変形によって対象岸壁の静穏度ならびに荷役稼働率が逆に低下することがあり，注意を要する．},

 abstract = {Wind wave and swell prediction are carried out by using third generation wave models and wind fields. Although predicted wave heights by SWAN show good agreement with observations, predicted wave periods are underestimated significantly due to underestimations of wave spectra in the low frequency range. WW3 predicts wave heights, periods and spectra correctly. The relation between wave heights, wave periods and wind speeds obtained by WW3 also show good agreement with observations. The mechanism of decreasing wave periods with increase of wind wave is well explained by the wave spectra and the combined wind wave and swell model. Several wind fields used as sea surface boundary conditions for wave simulations are also validated. It is found that predicted extreme wave height and period by using the wind field obtained from the mesoscale model underestimate tropical cyclone induced extreme wave height and period and these underestimations are improved by using the wind fields obtained from the typhoon model and the combined wind field.},

The SPH, which is the predominant method in the international research society, contains unphysical artificial viscosity due to its explicit algorithm. The ISPH method evades the artiflcial viscosity by introducing semi-implicit algorithm, however it suffers from another drawback, namely a pressure fluctuation. In this study, accurate schemes, which have been developed to enhance a stability of pressure in the MPS method, are applied to the ISPH method, with examining their applicability through some benchmark tests.},

 abstract = {In this paper, a fully non-linear three-dimensional Numerical Wave Tank (NWT) is developed for studying propagation and scattering of non-linear random sea wave over bottom submerged bars. The simulation of fully non-linear free-surface is based on Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline formulation (NURBS) as a novel approach and Mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian method (MEL). Highorder boundary integral equation is used to solve the Laplace equation in the Eulerian frame. To update the free-surface, time marching approach including material node method and fourth order Runge-Kutta time integration scheme is used. To obtain appropriate numerical solutions for wave propagation problem, damping zone is set at the downstream. Also, the NURBS approximation is employed to evaluate the velocity of the free-surface particles. Propagation of regular and irregular waves in a NWT is investigated and compared with the available experimental and numerical data. Transmission of the random sea wave over sub- merged bars is also compared with the experimental and prior numerical studies.},

 abstract = {The development of an accurate surface intersecting methodology and adaptive acceleration potential scheme, in order to precisely compute pressure on the wet surface of ships hulls, is presented. Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces are used to describe the ships hulls and the free surface evolutions. The intersection of free surface with ship hull is found by solving the resultant system of equations yielded from surface intersecting scheme. The pressure distribution over the exact wet surface of ship hull surface is obtained based on acceleration potential in a time domain simulation. Hence, implicit body boundary condition is applied to evaluate the time derivative of velocity potential on the hull surface in a fully nonlinear numerical wave tank. On the other hand, tangential derivatives of the velocity potential on the wet surface are approximated by B-Spline surface. Wave propagation is considered to examine the accuracy and convergence of the present solution. Motions of a Wigley hulls in linear wave are compared with experimental measurements and prior numerical solutions to verify the present numerical procedure. Also, fully nonlinear motions of a Wigley hull in nonlinear wave is simulated.},

 abstract = {A study, by two of the major contributors to the theory, of the inverse scattering transform and its application to problems of nonlinear dispersive waves that arise in fluid dynamics, plasma physics, nonlinear optics, particle physics, crystal lattice theory, nonlinear circuit theory and other areas. A soliton is a localised pulse-like nonlinear wave that possesses remarkable stability properties. Typically, problems that admit soliton solutions are in the form of evolution equations that describe how some variable or set of variables evolve in time from a given state. The equations may take a variety of forms, for example, PDEs, differential difference equations, partial difference equations, and integrodifferential equations, as well as coupled ODEs of finite order. What is surprising is that, although these problems are nonlinear, the general solution that evolves from almost arbitrary initial data may be obtained without approximation.},

It yields the well-known Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation in a quasi one-directional limit. A direct perturbation method is developed; it uses the underlying conservation laws to determine the slow evolution of parameters of two space dimensional, non-decaying web-type solutions to the Benney-Luke equation. New numerical simulations, based on windowing methods which are effective for non-decaying data, are presented. These simulations support the analytical results and elucidate the relationship between the Kadomtsev-Petviashvilli and the Benney-Luke equations and are also used to obtain amplitude information regarding particular web solutions. Additional dissipative perturbations to the Benney-Luke equation are also studied.},

 abstract = {A rogue wave formation mechanism is proposed within the framework of a coupled nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger (CNLS) system corresponding to the interaction of two waves propagating in oblique directions in deep water. A rogue condition is introduced that links the angle of interaction with the group velocities of these waves: different angles of interaction can result in a major enhancement of rogue events in both numbers and amplitude. For a range of interacting directions, it is found that the CNLS system exhibits significantly more extreme wave amplitude events than its scalar counterpart. Furthermore, the rogue events of the coupled system are found to be well approxi-mated by hyperbolic secant functions; they are vectorial soliton-type solutions of the CNLS system, typically not considered to be integrable. Overall, our results indicate that crossing states provide an important mechanism for the generation of rogue water wave events. C 2015 AIP Publishing LLC. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4906770]},

 abstract = {In 2013, a new nonlocal symmetry reduction of the well-known AKNS (an inte-grable system of partial differential equations, introduced by and named after Mark J. Ablowitz, David J. Kaup, and Alan C. Newell et al. (1974)) scattering problem was found. It was shown to give rise to a new nonlocal PT symmetric and integrable Hamiltonian nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger (NLS) equation. Subsequently, the inverse scat-tering transform was constructed for the case of rapidly decaying initial data and a family of spatially localized, time periodic one-soliton solutions was found. In this paper, the inverse scattering transform for the nonlocal NLS equation with nonzero boundary conditions at infinity is presented in four different cases when the data at infinity have constant amplitudes. The direct and inverse scattering problems are ana-lyzed. Specifically, the direct problem is formulated, the analytic properties of the eigenfunctions and scattering data and their symmetries are obtained. The inverse scattering problem, which arises from a novel nonlocal system, is developed via a left-right Riemann-Hilbert problem in terms of a suitable uniformization variable and the time dependence of the scattering data is obtained. This leads to a method to lin-earize/solve the Cauchy problem. Pure soliton solutions are discussed, and explicit 1-soliton solution and two 2-soliton solutions are provided for three of the four differ-ent cases corresponding to two different signs of nonlinearity and two different values of the phase difference between plus and minus infinity. In another case, there are no solitons. Published by AIP Publishing. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5018294},

Our general approach is both applicable to two and three dimensions and is very simple compared to previous wall boundary formulations. Based on a local force balance between wall and fluid particles we apply a pressure boundary condition on the solid particles to prevent wall penetration. This method can handle sharp corners and complex geometries as is demonstrated with several examples. A validation shows that we recover hydrostatic equilibrium conditions in a static tank, and a comparison of the classical dam break simulation with state-of-the-art results in literature shows good agreement. We simulate various problems such as the flow around a cylinder and the backward facing step at Re=100 to demonstrate the general applicability of this new method. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

 abstract = {The design of monopile foundations for offshore wind farms, the estimate of wave loads, and the effect of the structures on the environment usually consider one single vertical cylinder. This choice is based on the size of the ratio cylinder diameter to wavelength, and on the large distances between turbines. However, for large arrays of monopiles, the ensemble effect must be investigated. This study addresses monochromatic wave propagation through a rectangular array of four cylinders 800 m and 300 m apart, considered here as the fundamental geometry for an arbitrary array of monopiles turbines. Results for bottom velocities, mean water level, mass transport, and radiation stress tensor in the presence of the array are compared with those for a single cylinder. The numerical model WAMIT{\textregistered} is used to compute the potential velocity solution. Relevant spatial variations were found, especially for radiation stresses, for different periods and directions of propagation. Diffraction effects on the wave field by the array are significantly stronger than the superposition of individual effects of isolated cylinders under the same conditions. Impacts of the entire wind farm on bottom morphodynamics near the foundations, on the design loads, and on the wave climate past the wind farm are discussed.},

In the HSTWEC device, the power take-off system (PTO) was combined with an HST circuit and an electric generator to convert the mechanical energy generated by wave energy into electrical energy. Design concept and working principle of the HST circuit were firstly derived. Next, a mathematical model, control concepts and selections of main components of the HSTWEC system has been carried out for an adequate investigation of the suggested system. Finally, simulations using MATLAB/Simulink and AMESim software have been performed in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed HSTWEC. The simulation results show that more than 65% of wave energy can be absorbed by using the HSTWEC device.},

The results were validated with buoy measurements and wave energy and power was calculated with the numerical hindcast data. For characterization of wave energy potential, average annual and seasonal variations of the wave power in this area was firstly investigated. Second, wave energy development indexes and the probabilities of exceedance of wave power at the study points were determined. Third, wave energy resource in different ranges of significant wave heights and zero-crossing periods were characterized. Finally, It was found that annual wave energy of all points except Sinop point, whose annual wave energy is 10 MWh/m, is approximately 6 MWh/m and the bulk of annual wave energy occurs for significant wave heights between 0.5 and 2 m and periods between 2 and 5 s.},

 abstract = {A B S T R A C T This study analyzes the wave energy potential in the Black Sea based on long-term model simulations. A dataset covering the period of 1979–2009 is produced using a calibrated numerical wave prediction model (SWAN). This dataset was analyzed in detail to determine the wave energy potential to enable a reliable and optimal design of wave energy conversion devices in the Black Sea. This analysis provides information on the long-term variability as well as on the annual, seasonal and monthly averages. The analysis of the hindcast results is conducted on a spatial and a location scale. The spatial analysis provides information for the entire Black Sea on; the averaged mean wave energy flux over the period 1979–2009, and the decades 1980–1989, 1990–1999, and 2000–2009, seasonal and monthly averages of wave energy flux during 31 years, variability indices for the 1979−2009 period, and variabilities on monthly and seasonality basis based on inter-annual averages during 31 years. The location scale considered nine locations providing information on; wave power roses, probabilities of occurrence and cumulative distribution functions of wave power in different power ranges, variation and trend of yearly average wave power, seasonal average wave power and its annual variations, and quantities of wave energy flux for different H m0 and T m-10 ranges. Results show that areas with the highest wave energy potential are located in the south-western part of the Black Sea. These areas are; Burgas – Rezovo (BR) with an average annual total energy of 43.9 MW h/m followed by Dolni Chiflik – Shkorpilovtsi (DCS) with 37.3 MW h/m and Istanbul – Alacali (IA) with 36.1 MW h/m.},

 abstract = {It is known that muddy seafloors can extract significant energy from overpassing surface waves via engaging them in strong interaction processes. If a synthetic seabed can respond to the action of surface gravity waves similar to the mud response, then it too can take out a lot of energy from surface waves. Analysis of the performance of a mud-resembling seabed carpet in harvesting ocean wave energy is the subject of this article. Specifically, and on the basis of the field measurements and observations of properties/responses of seafloor mud, we focus our attention on an artificial viscoelastic seabed carpet composed of (vertically acting) linear springs and generators. We show that the system of sea/synthetic-carpet admits two propagating wave solutions: the surface mode and the bottom mode. The damping of a surface-mode wave is proportional to its wavelength and hence is classic. However, the damping of a bottom-mode wave is larger for shorter waves, and is in general stronger than that of the surface-mode wave. To address the effect of (high-order) nonlinear interactions as well as to investigate the performance of our proposed carpet of wave energy conversion (CWEC) against a spectrum of waves, we formulate a direct simulation scheme based on a high-order spectral method. We show, by taking high-order nonlinear interactions into account, that the CWEC efficiency can be significantly higher for steeper waves. We further show that the bandwidth of high performance of the CWEC is broad, it yields minimal wave reflections and its theoretical efficiency asymptotically approaches unity within a finite and (relatively) short extent of deployment.},

 abstract = {Similar to the mechanism by which a visco-elastic mud damps the energy of overpassing surface waves, if the near-shore seafloor is carpeted by an elastic thin material attached to gen-erators (i.e. dampers) a high fraction of surface wave energy can be absorbed. Here we present analytical modeling of the flexible carpet wave energy converter and show that a high effi-ciency is achievable. Expressions for optimal damping and stiff-ness coefficients are derived and different modes of oscillations are discussed. The presented wave energy conversion scheme is completely under the water surface hence imposes minimal dan-ger to boats and the sea life (i.e. no mammal entanglement). The carpet is survivable against high momentum of storm surges and in fact can perform well under very energetic (e.g. stormy) sea conditions, when most existing wave energy devices are needed to shelter themselves by going into an idle mode.},

We consider a fairly broad class of foil motion, characterized by nine non-dimensional parameters in addition to the reduced frequency. Quite simple analytical expressions are obtained in the particular case when just a chordwise flexure mode is superimposed to a pitching or heaving motion of the foil, for which the optimal conditions generating a maximum thrust force and a maximum propulsion efficiency are mapped in terms of the reduced frequency and the relative amplitude and phase shift of the deflection of the foil. These results are discussed in relation to the optimal conditions for a pitching or heaving rigid foil. The present theoretical results are compared with available numerical data for some particular undulatory motions of the flexible foil, with good agreement for small amplitudes of the oscillations and sufficiently high Reynolds number.},

 abstract = {Nonlinearities due to second-order bound waves do not, on average, affect the statistics of large wave heights. Heights of waves representing approximately the largest 1/3 of waves are described quite accurately, in particular, by Boccotti's asymptotic distribution (Boccotti, 1989). However, waves observed in some oceanic storms and laboratory experiments tend to display higher-order nonlinearities, causing the statistics of wave heights to deviate from the predictions of the Boccotti distribution. Herein, this distribution is modified and generalized so as to include the effects of such nonlinearities approximately. Analyses and comparisons of wave-height distributions estimated from two oceanic datasets representing waves observed during severe storms and a series of laboratory measurements suggest that the generalized model describes large wave heights well and noticeably better than the original Boccotti distribution and other models proposed for describing wave heights affected by third-order nonlinearities. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In Uruguay, investment in renewable energy has experienced strong growth in recent years. Because the country is located in a microtidal zone, wave energy is the most promising marine energy resource. An assessment of its potential was conducted from a 31-year wave hindcast performed with the Wavewatch III{\textregistered} third-generation wave model forced by CFSR (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis) winds. The model was calibrated and validated with altimeter data and in situ measurements. The spatial distribution of the resource and its variability at different timescales were analyzed, as well as the correlation between the variability of the directional wave spectrum and several climate indexes. The extreme conditions that a wave energy converter should withstand were analyzed, and a new figure was defined to quantify the impact of extreme conditions on WEC (Wave energy converter) design and optimization. The obtained results show that although wave energy potential is moderate, it is fairly steady throughout the year, and the extreme waves are relatively benign. Therefore, wave energy is an attractive resource for integration into the country energy mix, contributing to its diversification and sustainability.},

 abstract = {Fish Robots, especially bio-inspired robots that mimic biological creatures are gaining popularity in research field. Mostly the mathematical modeling, controlling of their kinematics, dynamics, swimming mechanism are main areas of interest. An intelligent Aquatic Robot generally exhibits three major functions, viz. guidance, control, and navigation. This paper is a discussion about the gradual development of these Fish Robots and their swimming, propulsion, locomotion mechanisms etc. that involved. The main obj ective is to bring forward a conclusive, relevant and useful conclusion from existing literature so as to boost interest in the emerging area of these Fish Robots. The fish locomotion is one of the prime inspirations of Fish Robots, and most of the bio-inspired Fish Robots are designed by mimicking the fish swimming profiles. The fish swimming can broadly be classified as Body and/or Caudal Fin (BCF)movements or using Median and/or Paired fin (MPF)propulsion. The swimming profile and characteristics of mostly used propulsion mode of various Fish Robots are discussed here in this paper. It is known that robotic fish propulsion mechanism is very complex to realize in models, it involves several aspects such as shape of the robot, hydro-dynamics involved, pattern of movement, control system involved, mechanical properties, location of various mechanical components and properties of the material used etc. Various structures and materials used in existing Fish Robots and significance of selection are reviewed. In future we look forward to develop better alternative techniques for locomotion and maneuvering.},

 abstract = {This paper evaluates the wave modeling performance in the Gulf of Mexico and Western Caribbean Sea employing three different wind reanalysis data. Wind reanalysis is employed as the main forcing in wave generation/propagation numerical models. While the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWFs) ERA-40 reanalyses have been previously assessed in the performance for wave modeling, ECMWF's ERA-interim and in particular NCEP's North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) are more recent reanalyses. They both provide better resolution and description of the wind fields and have not been evaluated for long-term wave modeling. Therefore, the aim of this work is the assessment of the three different wind reanalyses on the wave hindcast performance. Attention is drawn on the wind reanalysis capability for predicting both mean and extreme wave conditions during two different periods: (i) an anomalous year where cyclonic events dominate the extreme wave climate in the region (2005); and (ii) a year with the wave climate dominated by synoptic events (2006). A third generation wave model, forced by the different wind reanalysis data, is calibrated with National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys observations. Wind reanalysis data allow a consistent implementation of third generation wave models in order to predict the mean wave climate (correlation coefficient ∼0.84 for NCEP/NCAR, 0.94 for ERA-interim, 0.92 for NARR) for applied ocean studies. Numerical results revealed that both ERA-interim and NARR improve the wave modeling performance with respect to NCEP/NCAR (for extreme and non-extreme conditions), whereas the high- (spatial and temporal) resolution NARR data are more suitable for modeling extreme cyclonic events (i.e., hurricanes) in this region.},

 abstract = {We investigate the wave energy potential in the Caribbean Sea using a 30-year wave hindcast. Wave energy in enclosed sea basins, such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, is commonly associated with lower energy production rates. However, an easterly zonal wind reaching 13m/s, known as the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CCLJ), is shown to control the wave climatology in the Caribbean Sea. The wave hindcast information is validated with altimetry (Globwave) and buoy (DIMAR) data from the Colombian Caribbean Sea. The wave hindcast performance is very satisfactory at two buoy locations (Barranquilla and Providencia) and with respect to altimetry information, but presents an underprediction of extreme events at Puerto Bolivar. Therefore, an assessment of wave energy in the study area, based on wave hindcast information, is conducted to investigate the wave energy potential in such enclosed area. Numerical results suggest that the CLLJ region is suitable for wave energy extraction (8–14kW/m) and presents important spatial gradients that need to be considered for the installation of wave energy devices. Furthermore, it is found that locally generated (sea) wave energy can be suitable for energy production and hence future technology development should be devoted to its harvesting.},

 abstract = {Particle method such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Moving Particle Semi-implicit method (MPS) can handle quite complicated physical problems involving dynamic changes of free surface and crack propagation, and it is wildly expanding its applications not only in the fluid dynamics but also in the solid mechanics. Beside of these advantages, particle methods are not so easy to treat boundary conditions, like pressure Neumann condition and slip or no-slip condition in fluid dynamics. This is one of the typical difficulties in mesh-less type method. In addition, particle simulation model may include an incompatible step-shaped boundary line, which is made by using a simple pre-processing of particle model. Although the simple and robust pre-processing is one of the advantage of particle simulation, the step-shaped boundary may generate un-realistic numerical solution across the real boundary line especially in the fluid dynamics. Recently, pressure Neumann condition in SPH is re-focused with fixed ghost boundary method using virtual makers. In this paper, the fixed ghost boundary method is modified to treat the incompatible step-shaped boundary particles by referring the real physical boundary line. The accuracy and efficiencies of proposed method are validated by comparison between a numerical solution and experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Japan Society for Computational Engineering and Science.},

 abstract = {In this paper, a new particle-based fluid–rigid-body interaction simulator for violent free-surface flow problems is developed. The incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (ISPH) method has been proven to produce a smooth and accurate pressure distribution of free-surface fluid flow with breaking and fragmentation. Computed hydrodynamic forces can be applied onto rigid bodies, which may simultaneously experience contact or impact with the surrounding wall boundaries or another rigid body. Modeled by using the discrete element method (DEM), the contact force between rigid bodies is traditionally calculated employing the penalty approach, where a spring-based repulsive force is approximated at the vicinity of contact points depending on the deepest penetration depth. However, for high-speed collision problems involving a system of many rigid bodies, the values of approximated repulsive forces may be highly overestimated, and thus, a much smaller time step and an excessive damping parameter are often required to stabilize the approximated forces. This problem is highly inefficient for the computational resources of the fluid–rigid body interaction simulation since the computational cost at each time step is mostly dominated by the incompressible fluid simulation. The capability to increase the time increment following the critical time step of the fluid solver is, therefore, strongly demanded to increase the simulation efficiency. The current paper incorporates the usage of the energy-tracking impulse (ETI) method as an alternative approach to handle contact accurately. To achieve better energy conservation and enhance stability, Stronge's hypothesis is considered instead of the generally assumed Newton's contact law. The current work also covers three experimental validation tests, which were conducted to assure the quality and robustness of the coupled ISPH–DEM implementation.},

 abstract = {Wave energy is arguably one of the most promising renewables. Less developed at present than other renewables, the existing models to estimate the costs of a wave energy project are often oversimplified, and the resulting scatter in the economic assessments weighs on the confidence of potential investors and constitutes therefore an impediment to the development of wave energy. Indeed, understanding the costs of wave energy is one of the main fields of research in marine renewable energy. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to review all the factors that must be considered in an economic analysis of wave energy, including a number of elements that are usually overlooked. In the process we characterise the direct and indirect costs of a wave farm - preliminary costs, construction, operation and maintenance and decommissioning cost - as well as its prospective incomes. For each of them a reference value is presented, together with a generic formula for its calculation. Moreover, the levelised cost, i.e., the production cost of an energy unit (1 kW h), is compared between various energy sources, and on these grounds conclusions on the profitability and competitiveness of wave energy are drawn. In sum, this work reviews the state of the art and sets the basis for a thorough economic analysis of wave energy.},

 abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) estimates vary broadly, but most estimates predict significant increases in sea levels within the next century. Through the use of validated, coupled wave and hydrodynamic models, this study investigates SLR effects on storm surge and nearshore waves, including variation with coastal landscape type and storm characteristics. Both the wave and hydrodynamic models account for bottom friction based on land-use type, so the modeling procedure accounted for SLR-related changes to land cover, in addition to higher mean sea levels. Simulation of storms with similar meteorological characteristics and track but with landfall in the northeastern and southwestern coastal areas allowed examination of how the coastal features influenced the storm surge and wave response to increased sea levels. The simulation results analyzed here demonstrate that the relationship between storm surge and relative SLR (RSLR) varies between geographic region and storm scenario. The increase in an inundated area is linear in the north, and in the south, the inundated area approaches the northern values for similar storms asymptotically. Nearshore wave results indicate, as expected, that larger water depths created by positive RSLR and amplified surge allow larger waves to propagate into inland areas. For the Texas simulations, it was found that an increase in hurricane wind speeds of 25% is approximately equivalent to a RSLR of 0.5 m in terms of increased area of inundation impact. Because of the complexities of storm-surge dependency on storm strength, track, and local topography, there is no one-size-fits-all response to RSLR descriptive of all locations. Site-specific computer modeling should be used to evaluate the risk facing coastal communities.

 abstract = {Stability of the channel flow with longitudinal wall-oscillation is investigated by the Floquet theory. The stability equation, time-dependent Orr-Sommerfeld equation, is rewritten as a simple ordinary differential equation by the use of the collocation method. Then, using this ordinary equation, the Floquet exponents are defined. The velocity profiles for the Floquet analysis are given as superimposition of the plane Poiseuille flow with the Stokes layer. Reynolds number is fixed at 10,000 which corresponds to supercritical condition. Depending on the parameters, the parametric study shows that there is a stability spot on the parameter space in spite of the supercritical condition. DNS results agree well with the present Floquet analysis.},

 abstract = {Bivariate quadratic simplical B-splines defined by their corresponding set of knots derived from a (suboptimal) constrained Delaunay triangulation of the domain are employed to obtain a C1-smooth surface. The generation of triangle vertices is adjusted to the areal distribution of the data in the domain. We emphasize here that the vertices of the triangles initially define the knots of the B-splines and do generally not coincide with the abscissae of the data. Thus, this approach is well suited to process scattered data. With each vertex of a given triangle we associate two additional points which give rise to six configurations of five knots defining six linearly independent bivariate quadratic B-splines supported on the convex hull of the corresponding five knots. If we consider the vertices of the triangulation as threefold knots, the bivariate quadratic B-splines turn into the well known bivariate quadratic Bernstein-B{\'{e}}zier-form polynomials on triangles. Thus we might be led to think of B-splines as of smoothed versions of Bernstein-B{\'{e}}zier polynomials with respect to the entire domain. From the degenerate Bernstein-B{\'{e}}zier situation we deduce rules how to locate the additional points associated with each vertex to establish knot configurations that allow the modeling of discontinuities of the function itself or any of its directional derivatives. We find that four collinear knots out of the set of five defining an individual quadratic B-spline generate a discontinuity in the surface along the line they constitute, and that analogously three collinear knots generate a discontinuity in a first derivative. Finally, the coefficients of the linear combinations of normalized simplicial B-splines are visualized as geometric control points satisfying the convex hull property. Thus, bivariate quadratic B-splines associated with irregular triangles provide a great flexibility to approximate and model fast changing or even functions with any given discontinuities from scattered data. An example for least squares approximation with simplex splines is presented. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

 abstract = {This paper presents mechatronic design and manufacturing of a biomimetic Carangiform-type autonomous robotic fish prototype (i-RoF) with two-link propulsive tail mechanism. For the design procedure, a multi-link biomimetic approach, which uses the physical characteristics of a real carp fish as its size and structure, is adapted. Appropriate body rate is determined according to swimming modes and tail oscillations of the carp. The prototype is composed of three main parts: an anterior rigid body, two-link propulsive tail mechanism, and flexible caudal fin. Prototype parts are produced with 3D-printing technology. In order to mimic fish-like robust swimming gaits, a biomimetic locomotion control structure based on Central Pattern Generator (CPG) is proposed. The designed unidirectional chained CPG network is inspired by the neural spinal cord of Lamprey, and it generates stable rhythmic oscillatory patterns. Also, a Center of Gravity (CoG) control mechanism is designed and located in the anterior rigid body to ensure three-dimensional swimming ability. With the help of this design, the characteristics of the robotic fish are performed with forward, turning, up-down and autonomous swimming motions in the experimental pool. Maximum forward speed of the robotic fish can reach 0.8516 BLs-1 and excellent three-dimensional swimming performance is obtained.},

Mean wave power found to be below 2 kW/m along the coasts of the whole model area. The most energetic coast of the Southern Mediterranean Basin is Egyptian coast lying between Nile Delta and the Libya border with a potential of above 4 kW/m. Some regions along the coasts of some Greek Islands also have potential above 4 kW/m within the Aegean Sea Basin. The eastern part of the model area is found to be the least energetic.

The study is based on 10 years of data, from 2005 to 2014, from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.

An algorithm was developed to generate the scenarios, to estimate the installed capacity of wave farms at different locations along the coasts, and to measure the physical space required by the farms. This analysis of the four energy target scenarios resulted in a required installed capacity of 337 MW, 1.02 GW, 3.42 GW and 17.09 GW, covering a stretch of the total coast of 0.4, 1.2, 3.8 and 18.9% respectively.

The higher-order boundary element method is used to solve the mixed boundary value problem in an Eulerian formulation at each time step. The time stepping scheme updates the boundary conditions on the free water surface and body surface, based on a Lagrangian description. In order to increase the efficiency of the calculation, the domain decomposition technique is implemented, with continuity conditions enforced on the interface between adjacent subdomains by an iterative procedure. For the calculation of wave forces acting on structures, some auxiliary functions are used, instead of predicting the time derivative of the potential directly.

In addition, mesh regridding using the Laplace smoothing technique and interpolation are applied on the free surface to avoid possible numerical instabilities. Numerical results are obtained for the wave interactions with vertical cylinders and flared structures at different wave numbers, in which the bodies are fixed, freely floating in one direction and totally freely floating, respectively.

It is shown that troublesome aliasing instabilities are avoided for cold plasma simulation in which the Debye length is as small as 0.01 cell sizes. These new shape functions satisfy all requirements for PIC particle shape. They are non-negative, have compact support, and partition unity. They are given explicitly by cubic expressions in the usual triangle logical (areal) coordinates. The shape functions are not finite elements because their structure depends on the topology of the mesh, in particular, the number of triangles neighboring each mesh vertex. Nevertheless, they may be useful as approximations to solution of other problems in which continuity of derivatives is required or desired.},

@article{Batstone2013,
 abstract = {The impacts of storm surges represent an increasing risk to the world's coastlines. Coastal planners require accurate estimates of flood risk in order to provide suitable defensive measures. Therefore a reliable methodology is required for the estimation of extreme sea-level probabilities at high spatial resolution along coastlines. This paper describes a new method for estimating these probabilities, with application to the UK coastline. The method consists of two components: the estimation of extreme sea-levels by applying a newly developed statistical method, termed the Skew Surge Joint Probability Method, with tide gauge records, and the use of hindcast sea-levels to dynamically interpolate these estimates around complex coastlines. The skew surge parameter is a more reliable indicator of meteorological impacts on sea-level than the non-tidal residual used in the Revised Joint Probability Method, as previously used in the United Kingdom. The method has been applied to the UK coastline to provide a database of extreme sea-level probabilities for the Environment Agency for England and Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. The database will be used to inform coastal defense strategy, flood mapping and forecasting and to support policy, implementation and operational decision-making. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Bayati2014,
 abstract = {The objective of this paper is to assess the second-order hydrodynamic effects on a semisubmersible floating offshore wind turbine. Second-order hydrodynamics induce loads and motions at the sum- and difference-frequencies of the incident waves. These effects have often been ignored in offshore wind analysis, under the assumption that they are significantly smaller than first-order effects. The sum- and difference-frequency loads can, however, excite eigenfrequencies of a floating system, leading to large oscillations that strain the mooring system or vibrations that cause fatigue damage to the structure. Observations of supposed second-order responses in wave-tank tests performed by the DeepCwind consortium at the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN) offshore basin suggest that these effects might be more important than originally expected. These observations inspired interest in investigating how second-order excitation affects floating offshore wind turbines and whether second-order hydrodynamics should be included in offshore wind simulation tools like FAST. In this work, the effects of second-order hydrodynamics on a floating semisubmersible offshore wind turbine are investigated. Because FAST is currently unable to account for second-order effects, a method to assess these effects was applied in which linearized properties of the floating wind system derived from FAST (including the 6x6 mass and stiffness matrices) are used by WAMIT to solve the first- and second-order hydrodynamics problems in the frequency domain. The method was applied to the Offshore Code Comparison Collaboration Continuation OC4-DeepCwind semisubmersible platform, supporting the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's 5-MW baseline wind turbine. In this paper, the loads and response of the system caused by the second-order hydrodynamics are analysed and compared to the first-order hydrodynamic loads and induced motions in the frequency domain. Further, the second-order loads and induced response data are compared to the loads and motions induced by aerodynamic loading as solved by FAST. {\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In contrast to commonly employed projection approaches that strictly enforce incompress- ibility, time-consuming solvers for the Poisson equation are avoided by allowing for small, user-defined density fluctuations. We also discuss an improved surface tension model that is particularly appropriate for single-phase free-surface flows. The proposed model is compared to existing models and experiments illustrate the accuracy of the approach for free surface flows. Combining the proposed methods, volume-preserving low-viscosity liquids can be efficiently simulated using SPH. The approach is appropriate for medium-scale and small-scale phenomena.

@article{Behrens2012,
 abstract = {a b s t r a c t Wave energy is particularly abundant along the Australian southern coastline. Harvesting wave energy using a converter could provide a sustainable alternative for electricity generation for Australia. In this paper, the performance of three different types of wave energy converter (WEC) has been evaluated spatially for Australian coastal regions using Australian Renewable Energy Atlas wave energy data. It was found one of the WECs operated with a capacity factor greater than 54.3% for a large portion of the Tasmanian western coastline, while being located close to transmission infrastructure. The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for the WECs for these regions was in the order of $78/MWh. It has been known since at least the 1970s that electricity can be extracted from the ocean's waves, when the first WECs were con-structed and tested in the United Kingdom (UK) [1]. After a long period of stagnation, ocean waves and tidal currents are being rediscovered as a future source of zero-emissions energy, due to concerns about climate change and government policies focussed on the development of renewable technologies to reduce CO 2 emissions. Recently, CSIRO was commissioned by the Australian Depart-ment of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA) to produce a series of maps for wave, tidal and non-tidal energy distribution in the Australian region from the best available existing information as the marine component of an Australian renewable energy atlas [2]. These preliminary maps provide indication of a substantial but imprecisely quantified extractable resource, especially for wave energy. Several Australian companies have initiated ventures to use wave energy, either for water desalination or for electricity generation [3]. Wave energy is particularly abundant in the Southern Ocean; Hemer and Griffin [4] recently produced a fine resolution (w1 km) wave atlas for southern Australia. The authors estimated the total amount of energy crossing the 25 m isobath 2 between Geraldton, Western Australia and the southern tip of Tasmania (as shown in Fig. 1) as 1329 TWh/yr, or about 5 times Australia's current energy requirements of 254 TWh/yr. Turning just 10% of that into elec-tricity would involve a large investment of capital but it could satisfy roughly half of Australia's electricity demand. The focus of this paper is an analysis of WEC cost and perfor-mance, in an Australian context, using Australian resource data. This paper builds on the work of [4] and a growing scientific publication base which present the prospects of the Australian wave energy resource [5e8]. The paper begins with a brief expla-nation of how the wave energy resource is characterised and the types of WEC currently available [9]. Section 3 discusses the wave resource maps that have been developed in Australia and Section 4 covers the methodology and assumptions used for assessing the performance of three types of WEC along the Australian coastline. The WEC device performance is shown in Section 5. The results, as levelised cost of electricity (LCOE), are provided in Section 6, followed by a discussion and the conclusions. 2. Ocean wave properties and power generation Surface ocean waves are generated by the wind and can propa-gate large distances across the deep ocean, because the rate of energy loss is small until the waves reach shallow water and start experiencing frictional drag on the seafloor [10]. In deep water, the energy flux E w (in kW per m of wavefront) is approximately (see [11]) E w ¼ 0:49 {\^{A}} T e {\^{A}} H 2 s (1) where T e is the wave energy period (approximately equal to 0.86 times T p , the period of the waves at the spectral energy peak) and H s is the significant wave height (or average height of the upper},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as the major trend in shaping the development of the next generation of information networks. The challenges of the enormous, dynamic, incredibly diverse and high complexity of the IoT urgently require novel self-organization scheme because most of the existing distributed self-organization schemes cannot be directly applied to it. In this paper, we propose an intelligent self-organizing scheme (ISOS) for the IoT inspired by the endocrine regulating mechanism. For each node in the network, an autonomous area is established, where the node can effectively interact with its peers and perform self-control according to its own status and dynamic circumstance in a decentralized infrastructure. By introducing the hormone mechanism as the medium for information transmission and data sharing, the nodes can collaborate with each other and work in a cooperative way. Through adjusting the release procedure of the hormones, the ability to effectively detect service randomly generated can also be guaranteed in the probabilistic partially-working IoT. Simulation results verify the performance of the proposed mechanism that entitles the IoT to the ability of maintaining its status in a globally stable status, while effectively discovering the random service requests in a resource-critical configuration. The ISOS would be of great significance for the practical implementation of the IoT.},

 abstract = {This paper provides a summary of the work done within the OC6 Phase II project, which was focused on the implementation and verification of an advanced soil–structure interaction model for offshore wind system design and analysis. The soil–structure interaction model comes from the REDWIN project and uses an elastoplastic, macroelement model with kinematic hardening, which captures the stiffness and damping characteristics of offshore wind foundations more accurately than more traditional and simplified soil–structure interaction modeling approaches. Participants in the OC6 project integrated this macroelement capability to coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic offshore wind turbine modeling tools and verified the implementation by comparing simulation results across the modeling tools for an example monopile design. The simulation results were also compared to more traditional soil–structure interaction modeling approaches like apparent fixity, coupled springs, and distributed springs models. The macroelement approach resulted in smaller overall loading in the system due to both shifts in the system frequencies and increased energy dissipation. No validation work was performed, but the macroelement approach has shown increased accuracy within the REDWIN project, resulting in decreased uncertainty in the design.

 abstract = {a b s t r a c t The Cape Verde Islands form an archipelago off the African coast in the Atlantic Ocean. Since it is highly dependent on fossil fuels, Cape Verde decision makers have started to take into account also the potential of renewable energies, especially wind and solar. In particular, wind power has already 26 MW installed. From this perspective, the present work aims to be a first step in the evaluation of a different source of renewable energy, the wave energy. Using reanalysis data from ECMWF, the SWAN model was run for a 10-year period, covering the time interval 2004e2013, using a methodology already implemented in other island environments. Moreover, three years of this high resolution data are compared with the available altimetry data. In this way, a dataset of the sea state conditions around Cape Verde Islands was produced. This dataset is further used for wave climate analyses and wave energy resource assessments. This study indicates that the coastal environment of the Cape Verde Islands, and especially some particular areas, present considerable wave energy resources that should be taken in consideration for extraction in the near future.},

@article{Bigg1983a,
 abstract = {REVIEWS Tsunamis: Their Science and Engineering. Edited by K. IDA and T. IWASAKI. With the Pacific coastline, and in particular Japan, having suffered severely from tsunamis in the past, i t was appropriate that the May 1981 International Tsunami symposium of the IUGG Tsunami Commission should be held in the Sanriku district of northern Honshu. This book contains the selected proceedings of the symposium, one of a biannual series of meetings. Of the total of 55 papers presented a t the symposium, 39, giving a representative cross-section both of the contents of the meeting and of tsunamic literature, have been included in the present volume, after review. As the programme of the symposium is included in the book, the papers omitted can be noted by the reader. However, abstracts of these communications are not presented, which, given the recent decline in tsunami-related papers appearing in journals, is to be regretted. The book opens with the welcoming addresses of the meeting and then proceeds to present the papers in seven sections, dealing with the gamut of tsunamic research activities. The first subdivision, of 2 papers, deals with tsunami impact on society and forms a good introduction to the volume, including apposite remarks on the prospect of future disasters. The second section consists of 6 contributions on tsunamigenic earthquakes and ways of connecting earthquake severity to the magnitude of the resultant tsunami. The papers are representative of the largely empirical attempts to quantify ideas in this field and contain some interesting proposals for recognizing tsunamigenic earthquakes from their Rayleigh-wave spectra. Historical and statistical studies constitute the third section, of 9 papers. They convey a good impression of the difficulty in interpreting historical perspective. Some evidence for shelf modes playing an important role in the reception problem is given, as a result of tsunami spectra analyses. The fourth section. 4 papers on tsunami generation and propagation, is the weakest in the book. There are some parts needing greater clarity, and claims in one paper over the role of dispersion in the generation process need more convincing support. The results chiefly worry the edges of existing problems. Tho ncxt section, of 7 papers on the effects of topography on tsunami waves, is very interesting. The relatively unusual attention paid to transient, rather than steady, waves and several successful numerical experiments contribute to this. The penultimate section, of 4 contributions, deals with measures adopted in Japan to lessen the severity of tsunami impact. These include seawalls and breakwat,ers, and the reader is given both a n idea of what has been constructed and some of the considerations used in the design process. The last subdivision, containing 7 papers on tsunami run-up, shows well the difficulty of this problem and leaves the reader with the impression that there is shill a considerable distance to be covered before the run-up process is understood. It is clear, however, that progress was made by some of the papers contained herein. To conclude, it should be mentioned that there are several drawbacks to this volume, some of which have already been described. An additional one is the lack of editorial control over the standard of English expression, which, given the large Reidel, 1983. 563 pp. $113.00.},

In the context of our research on the social interactions of the zebrafish Danio Rerio, we developed a miniature robotic fish lure for direct underwater interaction with the living fish. This remotely controlled and waterproof device has a total length of 7.5 cm with the same size ratio as zebrafish and is able to beat its tail with different frequencies and amplitudes, while following the group of living animals using a mobile robot moving outside water that is coupled with the robotic lure using magnets. The robotic lure is also equipped with a rechargeable battery and can be used autonomously underwater for experiments of up to 1 h. We performed experiments with the robot moving inside an aquarium with living fish to analyze its impact on the zebrafish behavior. We found that the beating rate of the tail increased the attractiveness of the lure among the zebrafish shoal. We also demonstrated that the lure could influence a collective decision of the zebrafish shoal, the swimming direction, when moving with a constant linear speed inside a circular corridor. This new robotic fish design and the experimental results are promising for the field of fish–robot interaction.},

The model is based on a Eulerian formulation of the discrete spectral balance of action density that accounts for refractive propagation over arbitrary bathymetry and current fields. It is driven by boundary conditions and local winds. As in other third-generation wave models, the processes of wind generation, whitecapping, quadruplet wave-wave interactions, and bottom dissipation are represented explicitly. In SWAN, triad wave-wave interactions and depth-induced wave breaking are added. In contrast to other third-generation wave models, the numerical propagation scheme is implicit, which implies that the computations are more economic in shallow water. The model results agree well with analytical solutions, laboratory observations, and (generalized) field observations.},

 abstract = {Measurements are presented of the water particle kinematics of focused wave groups generated in the U.K. Coastal Research Facility. Single and repeated wave groups are considered at normal and 20° incidence to a 1:20 plane beach. The single focused wave groups model extreme transient events without the complication of reflections during the data acquisition process. A symmetry-based separation of harmonics method is used to interpret the water particle kinematics at the point of focus. Although the largest component is linear, there are also considerable second order kinematics terms (both low frequency and high frequency). Away from the free surface, the 2nd order difference contribution to the kinematics is a return current opposed to the direction of wave advance. For repeated wave groups, the measured kinematics confirms the presence of a low frequency free wave, followed by higher frequency waves of the main group and trailing higher order harmonic waves. In the breaker and surf zones, there is also evidence of the saw-tooth behaviour of broken waves, followed by scatter due to breaker-induced turbulence. Pulsatile wave breaking of repeated wave groups at oblique incidence is found to drive a longshore current.},

The undulating plate of small aspect ratio is mounted horizontally in the centerline about 2 ft below water level. The plate is hinged near the leading edge in a support frame and is excited harmonically at one-third of the chord. Ten different plates, all about 1×3 ft, were tested. The maximum speed obtained was 5.1 fps. Maximum propulsive efficiencies obtained in the tests were only 16%. However, theoretical work indicates that extremely high efficiencies may occur in certain designs. If the efficiencies can be improved, applications are likely because of one or more of the following advantages: No shaft-sealing problems, low acoustic noise level, small idling drag, good thrust control, or safe environment for swimmers. However, speeds will probably remain below 15 knots. A systematic parameter study is required to determine the highly efficient configurations.},

 abstract = {In this paper the feasibility of wave energy exploitation off the Italian coasts is investigated. At this aim, the energy production and the performance characteristics of three of the most promising and documented wave energy converters (AquaBuOY, Pelamis and Wave Dragon) are estimated for two of the most energetic Italian locations. The sites are Alghero, on the western coast of Sardinia and Mazara del Vallo, on the Sicily Strait and they have respectively an average annual wave power of 10.3 kW/m and 4 kW/m, and an available annual wave energy of 90 MWh/m and 35 MWh/m. The energy production of the hypothetical wave farms is calculated based on the performance matrices of the wave energy converters (WECs) and on 21 years of wave buoy records, covering the period from 1990 to 2011. The estimated capacity factors are low (between 4% and 9%) compared to the ones obtained for the same wave energy converters in other locations and are affected by a strong seasonal variability. This indicates that the considered WECs are oversized with respect to the local wave climate and that a more efficient energy conversion would be obtained if they were downscaled according to the typical wave height and period of the study sites. As a consequence of the optimization of the device scale, at Alghero the deployment of 1:2.5 AquaBuOY, Pelamis or Wave Dragon devices would result in capacity factors around 20% and in a quite constant energy production throughout the year. In fact, the size reduction of the wave energy converters allows to capture the energy of the small waves which would otherwise be lost with the original WECs. The results of the present work suggest that deploying classic wave energy converters in Italian seas would not be cost effective but if the devices could accommodate a proper downscaling, their performance in energy conversion would become economically attractive also for some Italian locations.},

 abstract = {The formation of doubly-periodic patterns on the surface of a fluid layer with a uniform velocity field and constant depth is considered. The fluid is assumed to be inviscid and the flow irrotational. The problem of steady patterns is shown to have a novel variational formulation, which includes a new characterization of steady uniform mean flow, and steady uniform flow coupled with steady doubly periodic patterns. A central observation is that mean flow can be characterized geometrically by associating it with symmetries. The theory gives precise information about the role of the ten natural parameters in the problem which govern the wave–mean flow interaction for steady patterns in finite depth. The formulation is applied to the problem of interaction of capillary–gravity short-crested waves with oblique travelling waves, leading to several new observations for this class of waves. Moreover, by including oblique travelling waves and short-crested waves in the same analysis, new bifurcations of short-crested waves are found, which give rise to mixed waves which may have complicated spatial structure. 1. Introduction Although great progress has been made in understanding two-dimensional water waves – particularly steady two-dimensional waves – there is an extraordinary number of open questions about three-dimensional ocean waves and patterns – with two horizontal and one vertical direction. In this paper we address several questions about steady three-dimensional water waves, particularly when the depth is finite, and mean flow effects become important. The fluid is assumed to be inviscid and the flow irrotational. In the two-dimensional case, steady periodic travelling waves can be viewed either as waves on a quiescent fluid that are moving but steady relative to a moving frame, or, the basic flow can be taken to be a uniform flow of depth h 0 and speed u 0 , and then the wave can be considered as a stationary periodic wave on the uniform flow, in a fixed reference frame. It is this latter view that we generalize to two horizontal space dimensions. The main class of waves we consider are doubly periodic patterns on a finite-depth fluid, and our goals in this paper are fourfold: (a) to derive a variational principle for uniform flows with two horizontal directions which form a basic model for mean flow – indeed our theory gives a novel answer to the question: what is mean flow?, (b) to derive a variational principle for doubly periodic patterns},

 abstract = {A new theory for the emergence of dispersion in shallow water hydrodynamics in two horizontal space dimensions is presented. Starting with the key properties of uniform flow in open-channel hydraulics, it is shown that criticality is the key mechanism for generating dispersion. Modulation of the uniform flow then leads to model equations. The coefficients in the model equations are related precisely to the derivatives of the mass flux, momentum flux and mass density. The theory gives a new perspective – from the viewpoint of hydraulics – on how and why key shallow water models like the Korteweg–de Vries equation and Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equations arise in the theory of water waves.},

 abstract = {This study deals with the development of a novel fully-nonlinear potential flow model for simulating the generation and propagation of 2D or 3D gravity waves in finite depth. This Numerical Wave Tank (NWT) relies on an original non-periodic High-Order Spectral (HOS) model (Bonnefoy et al. (2004) [3]). In this new fully-spectral formulation, propagation of waves is solved in a fully-nonlinear manner, while generation can be modelled up to second order in wavemaker excursion. The resolution is made by means of only Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), which leads to a fast and accurate method. The efficiency and fast-convergence of this spectral method enable modelization of the shortest wavelengths in a wave tank while keeping reasonable computational efforts. Several validation results are presented where numerical simulations are successfully compared to experiments on different 2D and 3D complex sea-states.

Namely, we will consider shape functions constructed using: moving least-squares approximation (MLS); radial basis functions (RBF). Using MLS approximation is appealing because polynomial consistency of the particle approximation can be enforced. RBFs further appeal as they allow one to dispense with the smoothing-length -- the parameter in the SPH method which governs the number of particles within the support of the shape function. Currently, only ad hoc methods for choosing the smoothing-length exist. We ensure that any enhancement retains the conservative and meshfree nature of SPH. In doing so, we derive a new set of variationally-consistent hydrodynamic equations. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the new equations on the Sod shock tube problem.},

The fate of these ra- dionuclides depends in large part on their oceanic geochemistry, physical processes, and biological uptake. Whereas radioactivity on land can be re- sampled and its distribution mapped, releases to the marine environment are harder to characterize owing to variability in ocean currents and the general challenges of sampling at sea. Five years later, it is appropriate to review what happened in terms of the sources, transport, and fate of these radionuclides in the ocean. In addition to the oceanic behavior of these contaminants, this review considers the potential health effects and societal impacts.},

@article{Cabezon2017,
 abstract = {Aims. Hydrodynamical instabilities and shocks are ubiquitous in astrophysical scenarios. Therefore, an accurate numerical simulation of these phenomena is mandatory to correctly model and understand many astrophysical events, such as supernovas, stellar collisions, or planetary formation. In this work, we attempt to address many of the problems that a commonly used technique, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), has when dealing with subsonic hydrodynamical instabilities or shocks. To that aim we built a new SPH code named SPHYNX, that includes many of the recent advances in the SPH technique and some other new ones, which we present here. Methods. SPHYNX is of Newtonian type and grounded in the Euler-Lagrange formulation of the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics technique. Its distinctive features are: the use of an integral approach to estimating the gradients; the use of a flexible family of interpolators called sinc kernels, which suppress pairing instability; and the incorporation of a new type of volume element which provides a better partition of the unity. Unlike other modern formulations, which consider volume elements linked to pressure, our volume element choice relies on density. SPHYNX is, therefore, a density-based SPH code. Results. A novel computational hydrodynamic code oriented to Astrophysical applications is described, discussed, and validated in the following pages. The ensuing code conserves mass, linear and angular momentum, energy, entropy, and preserves kernel normalization even in strong shocks. In our proposal, the estimation of gradients is enhanced using an integral approach. Additionally, we introduce a new family of volume elements which reduce the so-called tensile instability. Both features help to suppress the damp which often prevents the growth of hydrodynamic instabilities in regular SPH codes. Conclusions. On the whole, SPHYNX has passed the verification tests described below. For identical particle setting and initial conditions the results were similar (or better in some particular cases) than those obtained with other SPH schemes such as GADGET-2, PSPH or with the recent density-independent formulation (DISPH) and conservative reproducing kernel (CRKSPH) techniques.},

@article{Camassa1994,
 abstract = {This chapter discusses about a new integrable shallow water equation. Completely integrable nonlinear partial differential equations arise at various levels of approximation in shallow water theory. Such equations possess soliton solutions-coherent (spatially localized) structures that interact nonlinearly among themselves and then re-emerge, retaining their identity and showing particle-like scattering behavior. This chapter discusses a newly discovered, completely integrable dispersive shallow-water equation found by Camassa and Holm in 1993. This equation is obtained by using a small-wave-amplitude asymptotic expansion directly in the Hamiltonian for the vertically averaged incompressible Euler's equations, after substituting a solution ansatz of columnar fluid motion and restricting to an invariant manifold for unidirectional motion of waves at the free surface under the influence of gravity. Section II of the chapter derives the one-dimensional Green-Naghdi equations. Section III uses Hamiltonian methods to newly discovered equation for unidirectional waves. Section IV analyzes the behavior of the solutions of the equation and shows that certain initial conditions develop a vertical slope in finite time. It is also shown that there exist stable multisoliton solutions. Section V demonstrates the existence of an infinite number of conservation laws for the equation that follow from its bi-Hamiltonian property. ?? 1994, Academic Press Inc.},

To do so, the body is modelled as a Kirchhoff beam, made up of elliptical cross-sections whose size may vary along the body, undergoing prescribed deformations consisting of yaw and pitch bending. The fluid velocity potential is decomposed into two parts corresponding to the unperturbed potential flow, which is assumed to be known, and to the perturbation flow. The Laplace equation and the corresponding Neumann's boundary conditions governing the perturbation velocity potential are expressed in terms of curvilinear coordinates which follow the body during its motion, thus allowing the boundary of the body to be considered as a fixed surface. Equations are simplified according to the slenderness of the body and the weakness of the non-uniformity of the unperturbed flow. These simplifications allow the pressure acting on the body to be determined analytically using the classical Bernoulli equation, which is then integrated over the body. The model is finally used to investigate the passive and the active swimming of a fish in a K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortex street. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cambridge University Press.},

The body is modelled as an inextensible and unshearable (Kirchhoff) beam, whose cross-sections are elliptic, undergoing prescribed deformations, consisting of yaw and pitch bending. The surrounding fluid is assumed to be inviscid, and irrotational everywhere, except in a thin vortical wake. The Laplace equation and the corresponding Neumann boundary conditions are first written in terms of the body coordinates of a beam treating the body as a fixed surface. They are then simplified according to the slenderness of the body and its kinematics. Because the equations are linear, the velocity potential is sought as a sum of two terms which are linked respectively to the axial movements of the beam and to its lateral movements. The lateral component of the velocity potential is decomposed further into two sub-components, in order to exhibit explicitly the role of the two-dimensional potential flow produced by the lateral motion of the cross-section, and the role played by the curvature effects of the beam on the cross-sectional flow. The pressure, which is given by Bernoulli's equation, is integrated along the body surface, and the expressions for the resultant and the moment are derived analytically. Thereafter, the validity of the force and moment obtained analytically is checked by comparisons with Navier–Stokes simulations (using Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations), and relatively good agreements are observed.},

 abstract = {A unified discretization of rigid solids and fluids is introduced, allowing for resolved simulations of fluid-solid phases within a meshless framework. The numerical solution, attained by Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and a variation of Discrete Element Method (DEM), the Distributed Contact Discrete Element Method (DCDEM) discretization, is achieved by directly considering solid-solid and solid-fluid interactions. The novelty of the work is centred on the generalization of the coupling of the DEM and SPH methodologies for resolved simulations, allowing for state-of-the-art contact mechanics theories to be used in arbitrary geometries, while fluid to solid and vice versa momentum transfers are accurately described. The methods are introduced, analysed and discussed. Initial validations on the DCDEM and the fluid coupling are presented, drawing from test cases in the literature. An experimental campaign serves as a validation point for complex, large scale solid-fluid flows, where a set of blocks in several configurations is subjected to a dam-break wave. Blocks are tracked and positions are then compared between experimental data and the numerical solutions. A Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique allows for the quantification of the flow field and direct comparison with numerical data. The results show that the model is accurate and is capable of treating highly complex interactions, such as transport of debris or hydrodynamic actions on structures, if relevant scales are reproduced.},

 abstract = {A ship would generate significant sloshing when subjected to underwater explosion loads; the sloshing will reduce the ship's stability and even cause the ship to capsize when coupled with internal liquid sloshing. It is of great significance to research on the characteristics of the sloshing loads in a tank to improve the ship's stability and security. The liquid sloshing in a tank is a complex process characterized with nonlinearity and strong randomness, and large amplitude sloshing is a great challenge for both theoretical models and numerical algorithms. Yet as a meshfree method, Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has great advantages of solving such large deformation problems because of the nature of self-adaptiveness and Lagrangian. This paper focuses on the SPH core issues, such as the accuracy and the stability of the kernel function and boundary treatments. Firstly, the accuracy and computational stability of four common SPH kernel functions are simply investigated by two simple cases, and a more appropriate kernel function is selected. Secondly, the dummy particles and a novel boundary treatment considering the boundary motion are applied. Furthermore, the laws of impact pressure of the two-dimensional tank under forced rolling with different excitation frequencies and excitation angles are studied. Then, the influences of a baffle for the liquid sloshing in a two-dimensional tank under forced surging are analyzed, and the action mechanisms of the baffle are summarized. Finally, the coupled motion of swaying and surging for a three-dimensional tank is studied, which aims to lay a foundation for further study on the influence of sloshing loads on real ship motions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {The selection of the appropriate wave energy converter (WEC) and site is the basis for the installation of a wave farm in a region. For this purpose, the estimation of the energy that any WEC would produce at any location of interest is fundamental. Despite all its importance, this information or the elements required for obtaining it are currently available only at specific coastal locations or areas of interest. This work develops a tool for computing the energy that any WEC would generate at any coastal location within the Rias Baixas Region (NW Spain). With this aim, a methodology which allows the consideration of almost all the total energy available is used to characterize the coastal resource with a high spatial resolution. Then, a matlab-based application called WEDGE (Wave Energy Diagram GEnerator) is implemented for easy access to the stored data and automatic reconstruction of the resource at any coastal site in terms of a high-resolution characterization matrix (or energy diagram). As a result, the information required for accurate energy production computation throughout the region is available whereby a combined WEC-site selection can be conducted. Finally, the tool is used to compute the energy production of a total of 23 WEC-site combinations in an area within this region where a wave farm has been recently proposed. The results will underline the importance of a combined WEC-site selection for proper decision-making regarding wave energy exploitation.},

 abstract = {The problem of evaluating potential integrals on planar triangular elements has been addressed using a polar coordinate decomposition, giving explicit formulae for the regular and for the principal value and finite part integrals used in hypersingular formulations. The resulting formulae are general, exact, easily implemented, and have only one special case, that of a field point lying in the plane of the element. Results are presented for the evaluation of the potential and its gradients, where the integrals must be treated as principal values or finite parts, for elements with constant and linearly varying source terms. These results are tested by application to a single triangular element, and to the evaluation of a potential gradient outside the unit cube. In both cases, the method is shown to be accurate and convergent.},

 abstract = {Tsunami run-up and draw-down motions on a uniformly sloping beach are evaluated based on fully nonlinear shallow-water wave theory. The nonlinear equations of mass conservation and linear momentum are first transformed to a single linear hyperbolic equation. To solve the problem with arbitrary initial conditions, we apply the Fourier–Bessel transform, and inversion of the transform leads to the Green function representation. The solutions in the physical time and space domains are then obtained by numerical integration. With this semi-analytic solution technique, several examples of tsunami run-up and draw-down motions are presented. In particular, detailed shoreline motion, velocity field, and inundation depth on the shore are closely examined. It was found that the maximum flow velocity occurs at the moving shoreline and the maximum momentum flux occurs in the vicinity of the extreme draw-down location. The direction of both the maximum flow velocity and the maximum momentum flux depend on the initial waveform: it is in the inshore direction when the initial waveform is predominantly depression and in the offshore direction when the initial waves have a dominant elevation characteristic.},

The novelty of this method lies in the kind of perturbations considered. Indeed, we work with perturbations that exhibit different levels of regularity on each boundary. This allows us to construct solutions that would have been out of reach otherwise. Another benefit of this method lies in the improvement of the regularity gap between the free boundary and the given one. Finally, some geometric properties of the solutions, such as symmetry and convexity, are also discussed.},

 abstract = {A new method is developed for the prediction of cavity on two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) hydrofoils by a potential-based Boundary Element Method (BEM). In the case of specified cavitation number and cavity length, the iterative solution method proceeds by addition or subtraction of a displacement thickness on the cavity surface of the hydrofoil. The appropriate cavity shape is obtained by the dynamic boundary condition on the cavity surface and the kinematic boundary condition on the whole foil surface including the cavity. For a given cavitation number the cavity length of 2D hydrofoil is determined according to the minimum error criterion among different cavity lengths. In the 3D case, the prediction of cavity is exactly the same as in the case of 2D method in span wise locations by the transformation of the pressure distribution from analysis of 3D to 2D. The 3D effects at each span-wise location are considered by the multiplication of the cavitation number by a coefficient. The pressure recovery and termination wall models are used as cavity termination. For the 2D case the NACA 16006 and NACA 16012 hydrofoil sections are investigated for two angles of attack using different cavity termination models. For 3D analysis an application for a rectangular hydrofoil with NACA16006 section is carried out. The results are compared with those of other potential based boundary element codes and a commercial CFD code (FLUENT). The effects of different Reynolds numbers (Rn) on the cavitation behavior are also investigated. The results developed from present method are in a good agreement with those obtained from the others. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Chau1992,
 abstract = {The main difficulty in second-order diffraction analysis stems from the contribution of the second-order potential, which obeys an inhomogeneous free-surface boundary condition. In some applications it is sufficient to know the second-order hydro-dynamic force, which can be calculated without explicitly evaluating this second-order potential. This technique cannot however be used for calculating other quantities such as the hydrodynamic pressure at any point, the sectional force and bending moment in the cylinder or the free-surface elevation due to the second-order effects. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the second-order diffraction problem of a uniform vertical circular cylinder in regular waves. This furnishes results not only on the cylinder surface, but also on the free surface, and in principle in the fluid domain surrounding the body. The analysis may help to throw some light on the physical interpretation of the second-order theory and its mathematical description. Moreover, this information is intended to complement the development of general numerical methods for arbitrary bodies.},

@article{Chawdhury2016,
 abstract = {The paper presents a novel extension of the two-dimensional Vortex Particle Method which allows complex transient flow features computed by an original simulation to be recreated for use as inflow conditions in other simulations. This is facilitated by recording velocity time signals of the original simulation and computing time traces of vortex particles to be seeded into the secondary simulation near its upstream domain boundary. The proposed Flow Reproduction Method (FRM) thus allows us to re-create the flow field, without the need to simulate the underlying physics responsible for the flow features. A natural field of application is the re-creation of wakes from flows past bluff bodies of arbitrarily complex geometry, the resolution of which is computationally expensive. The recording is performed on a sampling system of the velocity field. Reproduction of the sampled simulation is then performed by inserting vortex particles in defined positions and time intervals into the secondary simulation. This proceeds in a smaller domain with the advantage of significantly reduced computational cost. In the simulations presented here, wake flows of upstream cylinders are reproduced. Convergence studies are performed to validate the FRM. The quality of flow reproduction is assessed and quantified. The computational efficiency of the reproduction simulation is enhanced additionally by using different adaptive numerical techniques. The method is then applied to fluid-structure interaction simulations of a wake buffeting problem. Good agreement is found between the dynamic response quantities when comparing original simulations and those with reproduced flows, whereby the latter are performed up to five times faster.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a unified formulation to explain the reason why spurious eigensolution occurs in the eigenproblem of interior acoustics using the real-part and imaginary-part BEMs and why fictitious frequency occurs in exterior acoustics using the complex-valued BEM. Both the two problems stem from the rank deficiency of the influence matrix. Based on the circulant properties and degenerate kernels, an analytical study in a discrete system for a circular cavity is conducted. The Fredholm alternative theorem is employed to study the rank-deficiency problems in conjunction with singular value decomposition updating technique. The spurious and fictitious boundary modes are found to locate in the column vectors of left unitary matrix. Also, the effects of different types of boundary condition on the spurious and fictitious solutions using direct and indirect methods are discussed. The mathematical and physical meanings for the nontrivial boundary solution in spurious eigensolution and fictitious frequency are explained. Numerical experiments are found to agree with the analytical predictions. {\textcopyright} IMACS.},

 abstract = {Collisions of counter-propagating solitary waves are investigated experimentally. Precision measurements of water-surface profiles are made with the use of the laser induced fluorescence (LIF) technique. During the collision, the maximum wave amplitude exceeds that calculated by the superposition of the incident solitary waves, and agrees well with both the asymptotic prediction of Su & Mirie (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 98, 1980, pp. 509–525) and the numerical simulation of Craig et al. (Phys. Fluids, vol. 18, 2006, 057106). The collision causes attenuation in wave amplitude: the larger the wave, the greater the relative reduction in amplitude. The collision also leaves imprints on the interacting waves with phase shifts and small dispersive trailing waves. Maxworthy's (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 76, 1976, pp. 177–185) experimental results show that the phase shift is independent of incident wave amplitude. On the contrary, our laboratory results exhibit the dependence of wave amplitude that is in support of Su & Mirie's theory. Though the dispersive trailing waves are very small and transient, the measured amplitude and wavelength are in good agreement with Su & Mirie's theory. Furthermore, we investigate the symmetric head-on collision of the highest waves possible in our laboratory. Our laboratory results show that the runup and rundown of the collision are not simple reversible processes. The rundown motion causes penetration of the water surface below the still-water level. This penetration causes the post-collision waveform to be asymmetric, with each departing wave tilting slightly backward with respect to the direction of its propagation; the penetration is also the origin of the secondary dispersive trailing wavetrain. The present work extends the studies of head-on collisions to oblique collisions. The theory of Su & Mirie, which was developed only for head-on collisions, predicts well in oblique collision cases, which suggests that the obliqueness of the collision may not be important for this 'weak' interaction process.},

 abstract = {The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant component of intraseasonal (30-90 days) variability in the tropical atmosphere. Here, traveling wave solutions are presented for the MJO skeleton model of Majda and Stechmann. The model is a system of nonlinear partial differential equations that describe the evolution of the tropical atmosphere on planetary (10,000-40,000 km) spatial scales. The nonlinear traveling waves come in four types, corresponding to the four types of linear wave solutions, one of which has the properties of the MJO. In the MJO traveling wave, the convective activity has a pulse-like shape, with a narrow region of enhanced convection and a wide region of suppressed convection. Furthermore, an amplitude-dependent dispersion relation is derived, and it shows that the nonlinear MJO has a lower frequency and slower propagation speed than the linear MJO. By taking the small-amplitude limit, an analytic formula is also derived for the dispersion relation of linear waves. To derive all of these results, a key aspect is the model's conservation of energy, which holds even in the presence of forcing. In the limit of weak forcing, it is shown that the nonlinear traveling waves have a simple sech-squared waveform.},

@article{Chen2017,
 abstract = {A velocity decomposition method is developed for the solution of three-dimensional, unsteady flows. The velocity vector is decomposed into an irrotational component (viscous-potential velocity) and a vortical component (vortical velocity). The vortical velocity is selected so that it is zero outside of the rotational region of the flow field and the flow in the irrotational region can thus be solely described by the viscous-potential velocity. The formulation is devised to employ both the velocity potential and the Navier–Stokes-based numerical methods such that the field discretization required by the Navier–Stokes solver can be reduced to only encompass the rotational region of the flow field and the number of unknowns that are to be solved by the Navier–Stokes solver is greatly reduced. A higher-order boundary-element method is used to solve for the viscous potential by applying a viscous boundary condition to the body surface. The finite-volume method is used to solve for the total velocity on a reduced domain, using the viscous-potential velocity as the boundary condition on the extent of the domain. The two solution procedures are tightly coupled in time. The viscous-potential velocity and the total velocity are time dependent due to the unsteadiness in the boundary layer and the wake. The solver is applied to solve three-dimensional, laminar and turbulent unsteady flows. For turbulent flows, the solver is applied for both Unsteady-Reynolds-Averaging-Navier–Stokes and Large-Eddy-Simulation computations.},

The paper first introduces an in-house three-dimensional viscous incompressible flow model (NEWTANK), which is used to simulate wave-floating structure interaction by using the VBF method. Then the coupling procedure between the mooring line model and the floater model is described. Some validation cases of the developed model, including the motions of a free-floating box in two different water waves, are presented. The present numerical results will be compared with the available experimental data and other numerical results from the published literature. After that, the validity of the mooring line in the numerical model is simulated by simulating the motions of a floating box in still water. Finally, the verified model is applied to analyze the wave-induced motions of a catenary moored floating structure, investigating the motion responses and mooring forces responses. The numerical results agree well with the experimental measurements on the whole. This indicates that the present numerical model can correctly capture the main features of the wave-moored floating structure interaction.},

The BEM is a widely used computational technique nowadays for MEMS and EM because of its superiority for unlimited exterior field.

Therefore, the approach to correctly and efficiently solve the singularity arising from degenerate scale becomes a very essential and indispensable task for engineers.

Generation of bubbles is performed frontally - starting from vertices and edges - and ending with surfaces and volumes of the analysis region after which a dynamic movement of generated bubbles is performed. The proposed method enables easy mesh density control using simple exponential functions with a very small amount of input data and very short computation time. It is applicable for automatic mesh generation of complex shapes and structures such as those usually encountered in various electromagnetic devices (rotating machines and transformers). Due to its modest requirement for input data and its ability to generate meshes with graded mesh densities, the proposed method could also be very useful for adaptive mesh refinements in FEA. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

 abstract = {A domain-decomposition algorithm has been developed to handle two-phase flows with large deformation, breaking and fragmentation of the interface. The strategy couples a boundary element method with a Navier-Stokes solver combined with a level-set technique for the tracking of the interface. The former is used in the fluid region where the interface can be modelled as a smooth surface. In the rest of the domain the field solver is applied. This results in an efficient and accurate method. In this paper, the features of the used strategy are described and the challenges connected with the coupling are deeply discussed. The numerical investigation highlighted the importance of a proper rational study when CFD methods are considered. In the present case, a crucial aspect is represented by the domain-composition step, that is when the information from one solver to the other have to be properly reconstructed and made consistent with the receiver sub-domain.

 abstract = {This paper describes a numerical method for solving the fully nonlinear equations of motion for gravity waves propagating over an irregular rigid bed, in two dimensions. The scheme is based on a boundary-integral method developed by Dold and Peregrine1, and extended by Tanaka et al.2. The method quickly and accurately computes the position of the free surface of an inviscid, incompressible fluid in irrotational motion. The schemes of Dold and Peregrine1, and Tanaka, Dold, Lewy and Peregrine2, describe waves in a flat-bottomed domain. In this paper the method is extended to describe wave propagation over an irregular bed contour, and follows2, in that the domain is unbounded in the horizontal, with static flow at infinity. A conformal transformation is used to map the irregular bed at each time-step to a flat-bedded domain. In the transformed plane symmetry is used so that discretization points need only be used on the free surface. The conformal map is a relatively small contribution to the run-time of the computer program. The method is more efficient than schemes which use discretization points to describe the bed contour. The method's capability is demonstrated with computations of a wave breaking on a submerged elliptical shoal.},

Compared to other biomimetic vehicles, the chosen architecture has a lower propulsive efficiency but is easier to waterproof and capable to withstand greater pressures. To generate the alternating motion of the robot bio-inspired thruster, namely a plane fin, a transmission system was designed to replace the direct drive widely adopted in underwater biomimetic vehicles. The mechanical efficiency of two alternative mechanisms capable to actuate the fin were computed according to a preliminary sizing of the robot and its targeted swimming performances. Therefore, the more suitable solution was manufactured and installed aboard. At the same time, a proper navigation, guidance and control architecture (NGC) was designed and then integrated in the robot main controller. The proposed solution allows the vehicle to perform different missions autonomously once their profiles are received from the base station. Preliminary tests results and future works are discussed in the final conclusions.},

@article{Couston2015,
 abstract = {Landslides plunging into lakes and reservoirs can result in extreme wave runup at the shores. This phenomenon has claimed lives and caused damage to near-shore properties. Landslide tsunamis in lakes are different from typical earthquake tsunamis in the open ocean in that (i) the affected areas are usually within the near field of the source, (ii) the highest runup occurs within the time period of the geophysical event, and (iii) the enclosed geometry of a lake does not let the tsunami energy escape. To address the problem of transient landslide tsunami runup and to predict the resulting inundation, we utilize a nonlinear model equation in the Lagrangian frame of reference. The motivation for using such a scheme lies in the fact that the runup on an inclined boundary is directly and readily computed in the Lagrangian framework without the need to resort to approximations. In this work, we investigate the inundation patterns due to landslide tsunamis in a lake. We show by numerical computations that Airy's approximation of an irrotational theory using Lagrangian coordinates can legitimately predict runup of large amplitude. We also demonstrate that in a lake of finite size the highest runup may be magnified by constructive interference between edge waves that are trapped along the shore and multiple reflections of outgoing waves from opposite shores, and may occur somewhat after the first inundation.},

@article{Cox,
 abstract = {A method is developed for interpreting the statistics of the sun's glitter on the sea surface in terms of the statistics of the slope distribution. The method consists of two principal phases: (1) of identifying, from geometric considerations, any point on the surface with the particular slope required for the reflection of the sun's rays toward the observer; and (2) of interpreting the average brightness of the sea surface in the vicinity of this point in terms of the frequency with which this particular slope occurs. The computation of the probability of large (and infrequent) slopes is limited by the disappearance of the glitter into a back-ground consisting of (1) the sunlight scattered from particles beneath the sea surface, and (2) the skylight reflected by the sea surface. The method has been applied to aerial photographs taken under carefully chosen conditions in the Hawaiian area. Winds were measured from a vessel at the time and place of the aerial photo-graphs, and cover a range from 1 to 14 m sec$\sim$'. The effect of surface slicks, laid by the vessel, are included in the study. A two-dimensional Gram-Charlier series is fitted to the data. As a first approximation the distribution is Gaussian and isotropic with respect to direction. The mean square slope (regardless of direction) increases linearly with the wind speed, reaching a value of (tanl6 0)2 for a wind speed of 14 m sec-'. The ratio of the up/ downwind to the crosswind component of mean square slope varies from 1.0 to 1.9. There is some up/downwind skewness which increases with increasing wind speed. As a result the most probable slope at high winds is not zero but a few degrees, with the azimuth of ascent pointing downwind. The measured peaked-ness which is barely above the limit of observational error, is such as to make the probability of very large and very small slopes greater than Gaussian. The effect of oil slicks covering an area of one-quarter square mile is to reduce the mean square slopes by a factor of two or three, to eliminate skewness, but to leave peaked-ness unchanged.},

 abstract = {This paper discusses the bifurcation theory for the equations for traveling surface water waves, based on the formulation of Zakharov and of Craig and Sulem in terms of integro-differential equations on the free surface. This theory recovers the well-known picture of bifurcation curves of Stokes progressive wavetrains in two-dimensions, with the bifurcation parameter being the phase velocity of the solution. In three dimensions the phase velocity is a two-dimensional vector, and the resulting bifurcation equations describe two-dimensional bifurcation surfaces, with multiple intersections at simple bifurcation points. The integro-differential formulation on the free surface is posed in terms of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator for the fluid domain. This lends itself naturally to numerical computations through the fast Fourier transform and surface spectral methods, which has been implemented in Nicholls. We present a perturbation analysis of the resulting bifurcation surfaces for the three-dimensional problem, some analytic results for these bifurcation problems, and numerical solutions of the surface water waves problem, based on a numerical continuation method which uses the spectral formulation of the problem in surface variables. Our numerical results address the problem in both two and three dimensions, and for both the shallow and deep water cases. In particular we describe the formation of steep hexagonal traveling wave patterns in the three-dimensional shallow water regime, and their transition to rolling waves, on high aspect ratio rectangular patterns as the depth increases to infinity. {\textcopyright} 2002 {\'{E}}ditions scientifiques et m{\'{e}}dicales Elsevier SAS.

To accomplish this, we express the Dirichlet–Neumann operator as a Taylor series in terms of the surface and bottom variations. This expansion is convenient for both asymptotic calculations and direct numerical simulations. First, we apply this formulation to the asymptotic description of long waves over random topography. We show that the principal component of the solution can be described as a solution of a Korteweg–de Vries-type equation, plus random phase corrections.

 abstract = {This paper gives a new derivation and an analysis of long-wave model equations for the dynamics of the free surface of a body of water which has random bathymetry. This is a problem of hydrodynamical significance to coastal regions and to global-scale propagation of tsunamis, for which there may be imperfect knowledge of the detailed topography of the bottom. The surface motion is assumed to be in a long-wavelength dynamical regime, while the bottom of the fluid region is given by a stationary random process whose realizations vary over short length scales and are decorrelated on the longer principal length scale of the surface waves. Our basic conclusions are that coherent solutions propagating over a random bottom maintain basic properties of their structure over long distances, but however, the effect of the random bottom introduces uncertainty in the location of the solution profile and modifies the amplitude by random factors. It also gives rise to a random scattered component of the solution, but this does not result in the dispersion of the principal component of the solution, at least over length and time scales considered in this regime. We illustrate these results with numerical simulations. The mathematical question is one of homogenization theory in the long-wave scaling regime, for which our work is a reappraisal of the paper of Rosales & Papanicolaou (Stud. Appl. Math., vol. 68, 1983, pp. 89102). In particular, we derive appropriate Boussinesq and KortewegdeVries type equations with random coefficients which describe the free-surface evolution in this regime. The derivation is performed from the point of view of perturbation theory for Hamiltonian partial differential equations with a small parameter, with a subsequent analysis of the random effects in the resulting solutions. In the analysis, we highlight the distinction between the effective equations for a fixed typical realization, for which there are coherent solitary-wave solutions, and their ensemble average, which may exhibit diffusive effects. Our results extend the prior analysis to the case of non-zero variance $\sigma$2$\beta$ > 0, and furthermore the analysis identifies the canonical limit random process as a white noise with covariance $\sigma$$\beta$2$\delta$(X X) and quantifies the variations in phase and amplitude of the principal and scattered components of solutions. We find that the random topography can give rise to an additional linear term in the KdV limit equations, which depends upon a skew property of the random process and whose sign affects the stability of solutions. Finally we generalize this analysis to the case in which the bottom has large-scale deterministic variations on which are superposed random fluctuations with slowly varying statistical properties.},

The numerical method is based on the reduction of this problem to a lower-dimensional computation involving surface variables alone. To accomplish this, we describe the Taylor expansion of the Dirichlet Neumann operator in homogeneous powers of the surface elevation $\eta$. Each term is a concatenation of Fourier multipliers with powers of $\eta$ and its derivatives and is valid uniformly in wavenumber. These are easily calculated using the fast Fourier transform. The method is illustrated by computing the long time evolution of modulated wave packets and of approximations to the Stokes steady wave train. By imposing a surface pressure we observe surface steepening in large amplitude evolution, and wake and bow wave development for flows with a close to critical Froude number.

 abstract = {Carangiform fish, like mackerel, saithe and bass, swim forward by rhythmically passing body waves from the head to the tail. In this paper, the undulating motions are decomposed into the travelling part and the standing part by complex orthogonal decomposition (COD), and the ratio between these two parts, i.e., the travelling index, is proposed to analyse the waveform of fish-like movements. To further study the relative influences of the waveform on swimming performance, a self-propelled model of carangiform fish is developed by the level set/immersed boundary (LS-IB) method, and the in-house code is tested by two cases of flow past a sphere and an oscillating cylinder, respectively. In this study, the travelling index is varied in ranges up to 50% larger or smaller than the biological data. The results show that carangiform fish seem to favour a fast and efficient swimming motion with a travelling index of around 0.6. Meanwhile, we study several numerical cases with different amplitude coefficients (0.5$\sim$1.1) and tail-beat frequency (2 Hz$\sim$5 Hz), and then compare their swimming performance with each other. We found that the forward speed is closely related to the travelling index and tail-beat frequency, while the swimming efficiency is increased with the tail-beat frequency and amplitude coefficient. These results are also consistent with biological observations, and they might provide beneficial guidance with respect to the future design of robotic fish.},

@article{Cummins1999,
 abstract = {A new formulation is introduced for enforcing incompressibility in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). The method uses a fractional step with the velocity field integrated forward in time without enforcing incompressibility. The resulting intermediate velocity field is then projected onto a divergence-free space by solving a pressure Poisson equation derived from an approximate pressure projection. Unlike earlier approaches used to simulate incompressible flows with SPH, the pressure is not a thermodynamic variable and the Courant condition is based only on fluid velocities and not on the speed of sound. Although larger time-steps can be used, the solution of the resulting elliptic pressure Poisson equation increases the total work per time-step. Efficiency comparisons show that the projection method has a significant potential to reduce the overall computational expense compared to weakly compressible SPH, particularly as the Reynolds number, Re, is increased. Simulations using this SPH projection technique show good agreement with finite-difference solutions for a vortex spin-down and Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The results, however, indicate that the use of an approximate projection to enforce incompressibility leads to error accumulation in the density field. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

 abstract = {This paper presents recent advances in knowledge on wave loads, based on experimental work carried out in the CIEM/LIM large flume at Barcelona within the framework of the VOWS (Violent Overtopping by Waves at Seawalls) project. Both quasi-static and impact wave forces from the new data set have been compared with predictions by empirical and analytical methods. The scatter in impact forces has been found to be large over the whole range of measurements, with no existing method giving especially good predictions. Based on general considerations, a simple and intuitive set of prediction formulae has been introduced for quasi-static and impact forces, and overturning moments, giving good agreement with the new measurements. New prediction formulae have been compared with previous measurements from physical model tests at small and large scale, giving satisfactory results over a relatively wide range of test conditions. The time variation of wave impacts is discussed, together with pressure distribution up the wall, which shows that within experimental limitations the measured pressures are within existing limits of previous study. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

 abstract = {a b s t r a c t The performance and economic viability of the Pelamis wave energy converter (WEC) has been inves-tigated over a 20 year project time period using 2007 wave energy data from various global locations: Ireland, Portugal, USA and Canada. Previous reports assessing the Pelamis quote a disparate range of financial returns for the Pelamis, necessitating a comparative standardised assessment of wave energy economic indicators. An Excel model (NAVITAS) was created for this purpose which estimated the annual energy output of Pelamis for each location using wave height (H s) and period (T z) data, and produced financial results dependant on various input parameters. The economic indicators used for the analysis were cost of electricity (COE), net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR), modelled at a tariff rate of V0.20/kWh). Analysis of the wave energy data showed that the highest annual energy output (AEO) and capacity for the Pelamis was the Irish site, as expected. Portugal returned lower AOE similar to the lesser North American sites. Monthly energy output was highest in the winter, and was particularly evident in the Irish location. Moreover, the difference between the winter wave energy input and the Pelamis energy output for Ireland was also significant as indicated by the capture width, sug-gesting that Pelamis design was not efficiently capturing all the wave energy states present during that period. Modelling of COE for the various case study locations showed large variation in returns, depending on the number of WEC modelled and the initial cost input and learning curve. COE was highest when modelling single WEC in comparison to multiples, as well as when using 2004 initial costs in comparison to 2008 costs (at which time price of materials peaked). Ireland returned the lowest COE of V0.05/kWh modelling over 100 WEC at 2004 cost of materials, and V0.15/kWh at 2008 prices. Although favourable COE were recorded from some of the modelled scenarios, results indicated that NPV and IRR were not encouraging when using a V0.20/kWh tariff. It is recommended that a tariff rate of V0.30/kWh be considered for Ireland, and higher rates for other locations. In conclusion, Ireland had the most abundant wave energy output from the Pelamis. COE returns for Ireland were competitive for large number of WEC, even at peak costs, but it is recommended that careful analysis of NPV and IRR should be carried out for full economic assessment. Finally, a standardised method of COE reporting is recom-mended, using fixed WEC number or MW size, as well as standardised learning/production curves and initial costs, to facilitate confidence in investment decisions based on COE.},

Apart from computationally heavy approaches, such as those based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH), the vast majority of models employed in the simulation and analysis of wave energy converters (WECs) are based on boundary-element methods (BEMs). While BEM models have been shown to be useful, they have the inherent limitation that they are linearised around the still water level, with validity only on the immediate vicinity of this equilibrium point. In this paper, we develop a new modelling methodology, which combines the fidelity of CFD models with the computational attractiveness of BEM-type models. This flexible methodology can give representative linear models, or be extended into the nonlinear domain, as desired.},

Both closed-form solutions and the Mathematica(r) software package are used in many of the up-to-date example problems to compute the deterministic and stochastic structural responses for such offshore structures as buoys; moored ships; and fixed-bottom, cable-stayed, and gravity-type platforms. Throughout the book, consideration is given to the many assumptions involved in formulating a structural model and to the natural forces encountered in the offshore environment. These analyses focus on plane motions of elastic structures with linear and nonlinear restraints, as well as motions induced by the forces of currents, winds, earthquakes, and waves, including the latest theories and information on wave mechanics. Topics addressed include multidegree of freedom linear structures, continuous system analysis (including the motion of cables and pipelines), submerged pile design, structural modal damping, fluid-structure-soil interactions, and single degree of freedom structural models that, together with plane wave loading theories, lead to deterministic or time history predictions of structural responses. These analyses are extended to statistical descriptions of both wave loading and structural motion. Dynamics of Offshore Structures, Second Edition is a valuable text for students in civil and mechanical engineering programs and an indispensable resource for structural, geotechnical, and construction engineers working with offshore projects.},

@article{DeAndres2015,
 abstract = {This paper presents a study of several factors that affect the long-term performance of Wave energy Converters (WECs) based on the methodology presented in de Andres etal. (2013). This methodology consists of a sea state selection technique (MaxDiss), then this selected sea states are introduced into a numerical model in order to calculate the power performance. Finally this data are interpolated with a non linear technique (Radial Basis functions) in order to obtain the long term performance of a WEC on a long met-ocean data series with low computational requirements. In this paper, three types of converter, a one body heaving converter (follower), a two-body resonant converter as well as a deep water flap are investigated. Also four different locations with different met-ocean conditions in terms of the scatter plots and the sea conditions (swell-wind sea) distribution were selected (North of Spain, West of Denmark, Chile and West of Ireland). The methodology worked perfectly for all the selected alternatives, although it was demonstrated to work better for non-resonant converters that are not band limited in their frequency response. Also, the classical method of power production assessment based on the power matrix was reviewed, analysing the analytical spectrum assumption. The influence of more than one peak spectrum on the power production was found to be large on a sea state by sea state basis (??200%) but also on the Annual Energy Production (??40%).},

@inproceedings{DeLataillade2017,
 abstract = {With many countries showing a growing interest in offshore renewables, the development of floating support structures able to withstand extreme environmental loads is key to winning the race in offshore renewable energy deployment. Numerical modelling of these structures allows relatively inexpensive testing and selection of suitable designs. The research presented here focuses on the numerical analysis of the behaviour of different floating structure designs and the associated mooring dynamics under various wave conditions. Simulations are performed with Proteus, a relatively new and open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software actively developed by the ERDC and HR Wallingford, using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to model two phase flows. In order to allow the simulation of moving bodies in Proteus, a mesh motion module has been developed. The mesh nodes in the fluid domain are moved using the equations of linear elastostatics while displacement of the nodes placed on the surface of the moving structure is imposed through boundary conditions (see Figure 1 for an illustrative example of the mesh motion for an oscillating floating body). The mesh motion is taken into account directly in the Navier-Stokes equation that are solved in the Eulerian frame. Using input forces and moments from the CFD solver, floating body and mooring dynamics are solved using the open source C++ library Project Chrono. This library allows a fully coupled simulation of rigid and flexible bodies with cable dynamics using FEM, where collision detection of the cables with structures is enabled using node clouds for seabed and other obstacles. Verification and validation of the coupled two-phase flow and body/moorings dynamics is conducted in this paper with the help of experimental data of floating bodies with varying constrains and degrees of freedom. Figure 2 shows results of one of the validation tests where the Response Amplitude Operator (RAO) was obtained with Proteus for the roll motion of a floating body under different wave loads and compared to experimental data [1] and to other numerical models [2]. Validating the model for these cases allows us to simulate with confidence more representational scenarios for offshore renewable energy devices using, for example, a selection of the following floating wind support structures: deep draught platforms (SPAR), tension-leg platforms (taut mooring), and semi-submersible (buoyancy stabilized).},

@article{DeLaVillaJa??n2013,
 abstract = {The control strategy applied to the oscillating system of the wave energy converters largely determines the overall system efficiency and thus the energy production. One of the first proposed control strategies for this type of device is the passive control. This type of control continues currently to be considered because it can be implemented in a simple way: short-term predictions about the performance of the wave are not needed when passive control is applied. Moreover, the power flow is unidirectional, and the extraction system is subjected to moderate peak powers so that costs and dimensions of the wave energy converter components can be reduced. The main disadvantage of passive loading control is the low energy production compared with other control strategies, such as the so-called reactive control which requires bidirectional power flow between the oscillating system and the generator. This way, the device can extract more energy from the waves, but the global system requires large energy exchanges between the oscillating device and the generator. These energy exchanges cause high losses, and thus the overall system efficiency significantly decreases. Furthermore, the reactive control system involves high oscillating excursions that can become unacceptable. In this paper, a point absorber converter that uses a linear direct-drive generator and power electronics converters jointly is considered. This article presents a passive control strategy that optimizes the power transferred from the generator to the power electronic converter considering the copper losses in the electric generator. Applying this approach, the generation system efficiency increases significantly, and similar values of the oscillating system's heave excursions and the peak-to-average power ratio for both the conventional and the proposed passive loading are found. The formulation of the proposed method is presented as well as time domain wave-to-wire simulations in both regular and irregular waves},

 abstract = {In this study, influence of RF power on the structural, morphology, electrical, composition and optical properties of Al-doped ZnO (ZnO:Al) films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering have been investigated. Films were systematically and carefully investigated by using variety of characterization techniques such as low angle X-ray diffraction, UV–visible spectroscopy, Raman spec-troscopy, Hall measurement, X-ray photoelectron spec-troscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy etc. Low angle X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the films are polycrystalline with hexagonal wurtzite structure and which was further confirmed by Raman spectroscopy analysis. Its preferred orientation shifts from (102) to (002) with increase in RF power. The average grain size was found in the range of 15–21 nm over the entire range of RF power studied. The FE-SEM analysis showed that grain size and surface roughness of ZnO:Al films increase in with increase in RF power. The UV–visible spectroscopy analysis revealed that all films exhibit transmittance[85 % in the visible region. The optical band gap increases from 3.37 to 3.85 eV when RF power increased from 75 to 225 W. Hall measurements showed that the minimum resistivity has been achieved for the film deposited at 200 W. The improvement in the electrical properties may attribute to increase in the carrier concentration and Hall mobility. Based on the experimental results, the RF power of 200 W appears to be an optimum sputtering power for the growth of ZnO:Al films. At this optimum sputtering power ZnO:Al films having minimum resistivity (8.61 9 10 -4 X-cm), highly optically transparent (*87 %) were obtained at low substrate temperature (60 °C) at moderately high deposition rate (22.5 nm/min). These films can be suitable for the application in the flexible electronic devices such as TCO layer on LEDs, solar cells, TFT-LCDs and touch panels.},

 abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved. Slamming, the violent impact between a liquid and solid, has been known to be important for a long time in the ship hydrodynamics community. More recently, applications ranging from the transport of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in LNG carriers to the harvesting of wave energy with oscillating wave surge converters have led to renewed interest in the topic. The main reason for this renewed interest is that the extreme impact pressures generated during slamming can affect the integrity of the structures involved. Slamming fluid mechanics is challenging to describe, as much from an experimental viewpoint as from a numerical viewpoint, because of the large span of spatial and temporal scales involved. Even the physical mechanisms of slamming are challenging: What physical phenomena must be included in slamming models? An important issue deals with the practical modeling of slamming: Are there any simple models available? Are numerical models viable? What are the consequences for the design of structures? This article describes the loading processes involved in slamming, offers state-of-the-art results, and highlights unresolved issues worthy of further research.},

@article{Ding2013,
 abstract = {The study of this paper focuses on local and regional sea-level rise (SLR) and emphasizes complexities in impact assessment of SLR under combined hydrodynamic and morphodynamic conditions induced by extreme events such as hurricanes and typhoons. In terms of integrated coastal/ocean processes modeling, two case studies are presented: The first one is to predict flooding/inundation and erosion in a small-scale estuary in Taiwan induced by a set of SLR scenarios and local extreme hydrological forcing, which includes waves, tides, river floods, and sediment transport; The second case aims at simulating large-scale hydrodynamic responses (i.e. waves and storm surges) to SLR and a hurricane in a region-scale domain covering the northern Gulf Coast. The model is validated by simulating waves, storm surges and morphological changes by using local hydrological conditions. Prediction results show that the variations of water surface elevations, waves, and morphological changes are generally not linearly proportional to the static SLR; the rates of their variable changes are varying with location and topography/bathymetry. To deal with nonlinear features in unsteady and multiscale hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes in coasts and oceans, it is essential to adopt this integrated-process modeling approach for coastal hazard management in response to local SLR. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Dold1992,
 abstract = {A computationally fast method for calculating the unsteady motion of a surface on a two-dimensional fluid is described. Cauchy's integral theorem is used iteratively to solve Laplace's equation for successive time derivatives of the surface motion and time-stepping is performed using truncated Taylor series. This allows fairly large time-steps to be made for a given accuracy while the required number of spatial points is minimised by using high order differencing formulae. This reduces the overall number of required calculations. The numerical implementation of the method is found to be accurate and efficient. A fairly thorough examination of this implementation is carried out, revealing that high accuracies are often achievable using surprisingly few numerical surface points. Extensive calculations are also performed using modest computing resources. Some numerical instabilities are identified, although these would not usually be significant in practical calculations. A model analysis reveals that two of these instabilities can be eliminated by using suitable methods of time-stepping. Should the third "steep-wave instability" become significant, it is shown that it can be completely controlled by using high-order smoothing techniques, at little cost to accuracy. Using a routine to ensure asymptotic conservation of energy, this is confirmed by time-stepping a very steep (but stable) wave over thousands of wave-periods. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

@article{Dombre2015,
 abstract = {We demonstrate the accuracy and convergence of a new numerical model solving wave-structure interactions based on the fully non-linear potential flow (FNPF) theory coupled to a rigid body motion approach. This work extends an earlier model proposed by Guerber et al. (Eng Anal Bound Elements 36(7):1151–1163, 2012), restricted to fully submerged structures, by allowing to solve for freely floating bodies on the free surface. Although we are currently extending the model to three dimensions (3D), the work reported here only considers two-dimensional (2D) problems. We first introduce the FNPF model, originally developed in 2D by Grilli et al. (Eng Anal Bound Elements 6(2):97–107, 1989), Grilli and Subramanya (Comput Mech 17(6):374–391, 1996), and later extended to 3D by Grilli et al. (Int J Numer Methods Fluids 35(7):829–867, 2001). We present the implementation by Guerber et al. (Eng Anal Bound Elements 36(7):1151–1163, 2012) in the 2D-FNPF model of van Daalen's implicit method for fluid-structure interactions [see van Daalen (Numerical and theoretical studies of water waves and floating bodies, PhD thesis, Universiteit Twente, The Netherlands 1993) and Tanizawa (Proceedings of 4th Osaka colloquium on seakeeping performance of ships 2000)]. We then detail the numerical scheme used for coupling the FNPF model to the motion of a floating rigid body. Moreover, we propose a new numerical strategy for advancing the free surface front inspired by symplectic integrators, which achieves a much better performance for energy conservation. The developed algorithm is first applied to forced motion cases, for which analytical and experimental results can be found in the literature and used as benchmarks. The accuracy of the numerical solution for the fluid and applied forces is then discussed for cases with small or large amplitude motion. In the latter case, a preliminary investigation of non-linear effects is performed for the classical application of a semi-circular heaving cylinder, by comparing the computed hydrodynamic force to the experimental measurements of Yamashita (J Soc Nav Arch 141:61–70, 1977). In particular, the comparison of the magnitude of the force harmonics, up to the third order, shows the importance of simulating non-linear interactions, which become important as the ratio of the radius of the cylinder over the wavelength increases. In a second set of applications, we assess the model accuracy in dealing with freely floating bodies. As a first test case, we consider the decaying motion of a freely heaving horizontal circular cylinder released from a non-equilibrium position above the free surface. In this more demanding computations, we verify that total energy fluid-plus-body motion is well conserved, which confirms the accuracy of the fluid-structure interaction algorithm. As a second test case, we consider the free motion of a rectangular barge in waves and compute the first-order response amplitude operators.},

 abstract = {The open-source code DualSPHysics is applied to simulate the interaction of sea waves with floating offshore structures, which are typically moored to the seabed, such as vessels, boats, floating breakwaters and wave energy converters (WECs). The goal is to develop a numerical tool that allows the study of the survivability of floating moored devices under highly energetic sea states, obtaining the optimum mooring layout to increase lifetime. The moorings are modelled by coupling DualSPHysics with MoorDyn, a lumped-mass mooring dynamics model. MoorDyn represents mooring line behaviour subject to axial elasticity, hydrodynamic forces in quiescent water, and vertical contact forces with the seabed. Calculated mooring tensions at the fairlead are added as external forces in order to compute the resulting response and motions of the floating structures in DualSPHysics. The coupled model has been validated against data from scale model tests generated during the experimental campaigns for the European MaRINET2 EsflOWC project. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the coupling implementation with the lumped-mass mooring model, free-surface elevation, motions of the floater and mooring tensions are numerically computed and compared to experimental data. Overall, the results demonstrate the accuracy of the coupling between DualSPHysics and MoorDyn to simulate the motion of a moored floating structure under the action of regular waves. Going forward, this modelling approach can be employed to simulate more complex floating structures such as floating wind turbines, buoys, WECs, offshore platforms, etc.},

[1] This method is applied in the present paper to a study of a periodic problem. We find exact analytical formulae for a class of solutions u(x, t) such that at any moment in time t the potential u(x, t) of the Schr{\"{o}}dinger operator has only a finite number of forbidden bands in the Bloch spectrum. We find in this connection all potentials with a finite number of bands. This class of solutions contains as a degenerate limiting case the well known N -soliton solutions of the KdV equation, which decrease rapidly as |x| → ∞.},

@article{Dunnett2009,
 abstract = {The performance of three different types of wave energy converters (WECs) is evaluated at hundreds of Canadian locations using wave activity data made available by the Marine Environmental Data Service of Canada. Two Atlantic and three Pacific locations are found where at least one of these devices operates with a capacity factor of greater than 20%, while also being located close to urban/industrial centers. The economics of a nominal 25 GWh wave power plant are investigated at these five locations and compared among the three WEC types using two indicators: the 25-year life-cycle cost, and the required price of electricity for a 10-year simple payback period. The lowest required electricity price for a 10-year payback is $0.089/kWh, and occurs at a location near the Hibernia Oil Platform using the AquaBuOY WEC. The highest annual capacity factor is 32.1%, which occurs near the Hibernia Oil Platform when using the WaveDragon WEC. The 25-year life-cycle cost evaluations suggest that wave power plants at locations near Ucluelet, St. John's, and the Hibernia Oil Platform could all be profitable using either the AquaBuOY or the WaveDragon if a price of electricity between $0.10 and $0.15/kWh can be secured, depending on location and device. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@misc{Duraisamy2019,
 abstract = {A comprehensive review on bio-inspired fish robots has been done in this article with an enhanced focus on swimming styles, actuators, hydrodynamics, kinematic-dynamic modeling, and controllers. Swimming styles such as body and/or caudal fin and median and/or paired fin and their variants are discussed in detail. Literature shows that most fish robots adapt carangiform in body and/or caudal fin type swimming as it gives significant thrust with a maximum speed of 3.7 m{\textperiodcentered}s−1 in iSplash-II. Applications of smart or soft actuators to enhance real-time dynamics was studied from literature, and it was found that the robot built with polymer fiber composite material could reach a speed of 0.6 m{\textperiodcentered}s−1. However, dynamic modeling is relatively complex, and material selection needs to be explored. The numerical and analytical methods in dynamic modeling have been investigated highlighting merits and demerits. Hydrodynamic parameter estimation through the data-driven model is widely used in offline, however online estimation of the same need to be explored. Classical controllers are frequently used for navigation and stabilization, which often encounters the linearization problem and hence, can be replaced with the state-of-the-art adaptive and intelligent controller. This article also summarizes the potential research gaps and future scopes.},

 abstract = {Oceanic rogue waves are surface gravity waves whose wave heights are much larger than expected for the sea state. The common operational definition requires them to be at least twice as large as the significant wave height. In most circumstances, the properties of rogue waves and their probability of occurrence appear to be consistent with second-order random-wave theory. There are exceptions, although it is unclear whether these represent measurement errors or statistical flukes, or are caused by physical mechanisms not covered by the model. A clear deviation from second-order theory occurs in numerical simulations and wave-tank experiments, in which a higher frequency of occurrence of rogue waves is found in long-crested waves owing to a nonlinear instability.},

@article{Ebke2013,
 abstract = {The most popular and actively researched class of quad remeshing techniques is the family of parametrization based quad meshing methods. They all strive to generate an integer-grid map, i.e. a parametrization of the input surface into R2 such that the canonical grid of integer iso-lines forms a quad mesh when mapped back onto the surface in R3. An essential, albeit broadly neglected aspect of these methods is the quad extraction step, i.e. the materialization of an actual quad mesh from the mere "quad texture". Quad (mesh) extraction is often believed to be a trivial matter but quite the opposite is true: numerous special cases, ambiguities induced by numerical inaccuracies and limited solver precision, as well as imperfections in the maps produced by most methods (unless costly countermeasures are taken) pose significant challenges to the quad extractor. We present a method to sanitize a provided parametrization such that it becomes numerically consistent even in a limited precision floating point representation. Based on this we are able to provide a comprehensive and sound description of how to perform quad extraction robustly and without the need for any complex tolerance thresholds or disambiguation rules. On top of that we develop a novel strategy to cope with common local fold-overs in the parametrization. This allows our method, dubbed QEx, to generate all-quadrilateral meshes where otherwise holes, non-quad polygons or no output at all would have been produced. We thus enable the practical use of an entire class of maps that was previously considered defective. Since state of the art quad meshing methods spend a significant share of their run time solely to prevent local fold-overs, using our method it is now possible to obtain quad meshes significantly quicker than before. We also provide libQEx, an open source C++ reference implementation of our method and thus significantly lower the bar to enter the field of quad meshing.},

 abstract = {Dynamic boundary conditions (DBC) for solid surfaces are standard in the weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code DualSPHysics. A stationary solid is simply represented by fixed particles with pressure from the equation of state. Boundaries are easy to set up and computations are relatively stable and efficient, providing robust numerical simulation for complex geometries. However, a small unphysical gap between the fluid and solid boundaries can form, decreasing the accuracy of pressures measured on the boundary. A method is presented where the density of solid particles is obtained from ghost positions within the fluid domain by linear extrapolation. With this approach, the gap between fluid and boundary is reduced and pressures in still water converge to hydrostatic, including the case of a bed with a sharp corner. The violent free-surface cases of a sloshing tank and dam break impact on an obstacle show pressures measured directly on solid surfaces in close agreement with experiments. The complex 3-D flow in a fish pass, with baffles to divert the flow, is simulated showing close agreement with measured water levels with weirs open and gates closed, but less close with gates open and weirs closed. This indicates the method is suitable for rapidly varying free-surface flows, but development for complex turbulent flows is necessary. The code with the modified dynamic boundary condition (mDBC) is available in DualSPHysics to run on CPUs or GPUs.},

 abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Eto2006,
 abstract = {We review our recent work on solitons in the Higgs phase. We use U (N C) gauge theory with N F Higgs scalar fields in the fundamental representation, which can be extended to possess eight supercharges. We propose the moduli matrix as a fundamental tool to exhaust all BPS solutions, and to characterize all possible moduli parameters. Moduli spaces of domain walls (kinks) and vortices, which are the only elementary solitons in the Higgs phase, are found in terms of the moduli matrix. Stable monopoles and instantons can exist in the Higgs phase if they are attached by vortices to form composite solitons. The moduli spaces of these composite solitons are also worked out in terms of the moduli matrix. Webs of walls can also be formed with characteristic difference between Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. Instanton-vortex systems, monopole-vortex-wall systems, and webs of walls in Abelian gauge theories are found to admit negative energy objects with the instanton charge (called intersectons), the monopole charge (called boojums) and the Hitchin charge, respectively. We characterize the total moduli space of these elementary as well as composite solitons. In particular the total moduli space of walls is given by the complex Grassmann manifold SU (N F)/[SU (N C) × SU (N F − N C) × U (1)] and is decomposed into various topological sectors corresponding to boundary condition specified by particular vacua. The moduli space of k vortices is also completely determined and is reformulated as the half ADHM construction. Effective Lagrangians are constructed on walls and vortices in a compact form. We also present several new results on interactions of various solitons, such as monopoles, vortices, and walls. Review parts contain our works on domain walls [},

In this paper wave spectrum parameters related to transport, distribution and variability of wave energy in the sea are educed. Many different types of wave-energy converters, of various categories, have been proposed. It is useful to think of primary conversion of wave energy by an oscillating system as a wave-interference phenomenon. Corresponding to optimum wave interference, there is an upper bound to the amount of energy that can be extracted from a wave by means of a particular oscillating system. Taking physical limitations into account, another upper bound, for the ratio of extracted energy to the volume of the immersed oscillating system, has been derived. Finally, the significance of the two different upper bounds is discussed. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {The discrete infinite-dimensional modal system describing nonlinear sloshing of an incompressible fluid with irrotational flow partially occupying a tank performing an arbitrary three-dimensional motion is derived in general form. The tank has vertical walls near the free surface and overturning waves are excluded. The derivation is based on the Bateman-Like variational principle. The free surface motion and velocity potential are expanded in generalized Fourier series. The derived infinite-dimensional modal system couples generalized time-dependent coordinates of free surface elevation and the velocity potential. The procedure is not restricted by any order of smallness. The general multidimensional structure of the equations is approximated to analyse sloshing in a rectangular tank with finite water depth. The amplitude-frequency response is consistent with the fifth-order steady-state solutions by Waterhouse (1994). The theory is validated by new experimental results. It is shown that transients and associated nonlinear beating are important. An initial variation of excitation periods is more important than initial conditions. The theory is invalid when either the water depth is small or water impacts heavily on the tank ceiling. Alternative expressions for hydrodynamic loads are presented. The procedure facilitates simulations of a coupled vehicle-fluid system.},

 abstract = {An asymptotic modal system is derived for modelling nonlinear sloshing in a rectangular tank with similar width and breadth. The system couples nonlinearly nine modal functions describing the time evolution of the natural modes. Two primary modes are assumed to be dominant. The system is equivalent to the model by Faltinsen et al. (2000) for the two-dimensional case. It is validated for resonant sloshing in a square-base basin. Emphasis is on finite fluid depth but the behaviour with decreasing depth to intermediate depths is also discussed. The tank is forced in surge/sway/roll/pitch with frequency close to the lowest degenerate natural frequency. The theoretical part concentrates on periodic solutions of the modal system (steady-state wave motions) for longitudinal (along the walls) and diagonal (in the vertical diagonal plane) excitations. Three types of solutions are established for each case: (i) 'planar'/'diagonal' resonant standing waves for longitudinal/diagonal forcing, (ii) 'swirling' waves moving along tank walls clockwise or counterclockwise and (iii) 'square'-like resonant standing wave coupling in-phase oscillations of both the lowest modes. The frequency domains for stable and unstable waves (i)-(iii), the contribution of higher modes and the influence of decreasing fluid depth are studied in detail. The zones where either unstable steady regimes exist or there are two or more stable periodic solutions with similar amplitudes are found. New experimental results are presented and show generally good agreement with theoretical data on effective domains of steady-state sloshing. Three-dimensional sloshing regimes demonstrate a significant contribution of higher modes in steady-state and transient flows.},

 abstract = {Resonant sloshing in an upright annular tank is studied by using a new nonlinear modal theory, which is complete within the framework of the Narimanov-Moiseev asymptotics. The applicability is justified for a fairly deep liquid (the liquid-depth-to-outer-tank-radius ratio 1.5≤h=h/r2) and away from the non-dimensional inner radii r1 = r1;r2 = 0.17618, 0.27826, 0.31323, 0.31855, 0.43444, 0.46015, 0.48434, 0.68655, 0.70118. The theory is used to describe steady-state (stable and unstable) resonant waves due to a harmonic excitation with the forcing frequency close to the lowest natural sloshing frequency. We show that the surge-sway-pitch-roll excitation is always of either longitudinal or elliptic type. Existing experimental results on the horizontally excited steady-state wave regimes in an upright circular tank (r1 = 0) are utilised for validation. Inserting an inner pole with the radii r1 ∼ 0.25 and 0.35 (1.5≤h) causes that no stable swirling and/or irregular waves exist. The response curves for an elliptic-type excitation are examined versus the minor-axis forcing-amplitude component. Stable swirling is then expected being co- and counter-directed to the angular forcing direction. Passage to the rotary (circular) excitation keeps the co-directed swirling stable for all resonant forcing frequencies but the stable counter-directed swirling disappears.},

Special travelling wave solutions of this compact equation are numerically constructed using the Petviashvili method. Their stability properties are also investigated. In particular, unstable travelling waves with wedge-type singularities, namely peakons, are numerically discovered. To gain insight into the properties of these singular solutions, we also consider the academic case of a perturbed version of the compact equation, for which analytical peakons with exponential shape are derived. Finally, by means of an accurate Fourier-type spectral scheme it is found that smooth solitary waves appear to collide elastically, suggesting the integrability of the Zakharov equation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Cambridge University Press.},

 abstract = {Rankine source method coupled with Mixed Euler-Lagrange(MEL) algorithm is de-veloped to investigate wave-body problems. Under Euler specification a boundary-value problem is solved by placing fundamental singularities outside the computational domain and satisfying the boundary conditions at prescribed control points. At every time step, Lagrangian frame is applied to update the control points position during regridding pro-cess. A space increment method for source points distribution incorporating horizontal free surface source arrangement and vertical desingularized distance is developed and this method connects free surface panel to body panel size. By reducing the number of source points, this method significantly increases the computational efficiency. A single node scheme is implemented to treat intersection points. This scheme regards intersection points only as body panel ending points. The first source points on the free surface are placed away from the intersection points and generated wave is started from these source points rather than intersection points. During regridding process, body panel number keeps constant and panel size varies to match the variation of wetted body surface. In the process of repanelling the free surface, panels slide horizontally due to the variation of wetted body surface pushing them back and forth. After their horizontal positions are fixed, the source points follow the wave elevation and are located on the up-dated wave surface in the vertical direction. A least square based smoothing technique is developed to eliminate the " sawtooth " phenomenon occurred in the free surface updating for two-dimensional fully nonlinear problem. Both two-and three-dimensional forced body oscillatory motion problems are studied and extensive comparisons show a good agreement with published results. The methods developed are proved to be accurate, efficient and robust for wave-body problems.},

 abstract = {This study investigates the hydrodynamic performance of two freely floating or interconnected barges. A nonlinear decomposition model in the framework of potential flow is employed to simulate the wave-body interactions in the time domain. This piece of work focuses on the accurate calculation of hydrodynamic forces and motions of a multibody floating system. The hydrodynamic forces are indirectly calculated through an auxiliary function approach, which is extended to application of two floating bodies in the present study. The resultant coupled motion equations for two bodies clearly demonstrate the influence of one body on the other. To incorporate an interconnection between two floating bodies, a constraint matrix method is developed where the connection constraints are mathematically represented by a constraint matrix. The constraint forces in the connection are solved in the modified motion equations. The newly formulated coupled auxiliary function and constraint matrix approaches for two bodies with and without interconnections are validated by comparisons of first-order response against linear frequency-domain models. Two types of interconnections, namely, the rigid connection and the middle-hinge connection, are examined in both beam sea and head sea to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Coupling effects of different connection scenarios on body motions as well as the influence on constraint forces are discussed. Furthermore, simulations using relatively steeper waves are performed and compared with mild wave cases. The nonlinear effect is highlighted by decomposing the higher harmonic components of nonlinear responses.},

@article{Fernandez2013,
 abstract = {In the offshore industry there are two possible materials for the construction of the hull of any structure: steel and concrete. Steel is being widely used in the shipbuilding industry for merchant ships, warships, etc. Materials such as aluminium, glass reinforced plastic (GRP) or timber are also used in small units with lengths lower than 100 m and with less adverse conditions than in the offshore industry. Nevertheless, some ships/barges have been built of concrete in the past, but these have been rather isolated cases and have not changed the industry practice. During the First and Second World War concrete was used due to the scarcity of other materials, so the series of barges by Alfred A. Yee were a rare exception. Other floating structures were also made in concrete, but they are almost anecdotal. However, the behaviour of these concrete structures, especially in terms of maintenance, has been excellent. Therefore, the fact that concrete has not had an adequate reception so far in shipbuilding does not mean that it will not be the material best suited to the offshore industry in the future. The extra displacement and associated fuel costs in concrete ships have been found to be prohibitive in the past. However the loss of mobility in a concrete hull compared to a steel hull can be perfectly offset by the advantages offered by concrete, as the shipping and offshore industry now have very different priorities. One of the main differences in these priorities is the importance of maintenance and resistance to fatigue, precisely the areas where concrete performs the better. Ships can easily be dry-docked for maintenance and repair, while in the offshore platforms these works have to be done in situ, so maintenance and fatigue are crucial to them. Besides these aspects, concrete has other advantages, according to a number of findings in several studies. This supports the fact that in recent years concrete offshore units have been built proving that in certain cases the benefits of steel are inferior to those of concrete. Concrete gravity base platforms type Condeep have been building since the first unit became operational in 1976, together with a few floating platforms, that have geometry similar to those made of steel (barges, semi-submersibles and TLP type platforms). Offshore LNG terminals and offshore industrial plants utilise emerging concepts in concrete that are lasting for years. The life of these barges can be designed for up to 200 years, such as the floating Nkossa barge, so they can be a good alternative to the construction of these facilities on land, thus avoiding landfills on the coast that degrade the already punished coastline of industrialized countries.

@article{Ferrant2003,
 abstract = {This paper is devoted to the numerical simulation of non-linear wave diffraction by three-dimensional (3D) surface-piercing structures in the time domain. Two different methods are presented. First a second-order diffraction model is described, in which a boundary-element method combined with a time-stepping procedure are used to solve the first- and second-order diffraction problems in the time domain. The Stokes expansion approach of the free surface non-linearities results in relatively moderate simulation times, so that long simulations in irregular incident waves become feasible. The model has previously been systematically validated by comparison with available semi-analytical frequency domain results on regular wave diffraction about simplified geometries. In the present paper, the flexibility and stability of the time-domain approach to second-order wave diffraction are further demonstrated by the simulation of bichromatic wave diffraction over a large number of incident wave periods. The second part of the paper addresses the problem of fully non-linear wave diffraction. Again, the solution procedure is based on a boundary element method (BEM) solution of the boundary-value problem in the time domain, but the non-linear boundary conditions are accounted for without any approximation this time. In this fully non-linear diffraction model, an explicit description of the incident wave is exploited to solve the problem for the diffracted flow only. This approach has a number of practical advantages in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. In previous publications related to this approach stream-function theory was utilized to model non-linear regular incident waves. In this paper, irregular two-dimensional (2D) incident waves are modelled by means of a recently developed fully non-linear time-domain pseudospectral formulation. An original coupling of this 2D pseudospectral model with the 3D non-linear BEM model is proposed, and its effectiveness is shown on the case of 2D wave packets interacting with a vertical bottom-mounted cylinder. {\textcopyright} 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {The ocean circulation is a cause and consequence of fluid scale interactions ranging from millimeters to more than 10,000 km. Although the wind field produces a large energy input to the ocean, all but approximately 10% appears to be dissipated within about 100 m of the sea surface, rendering observations of the energy divergence necessary to maintain the full water-column flow difficult. Attention thus shifts to the physically different kinetic energy (KE) reservoirs of the circulation and their maintenance, dissipation, and possible influence on the very small scales representing irreversible molecular mixing. Oceanic KE is dominated by the geostrophic eddy field, and depending on the vertical structure (barotropic versus low-mode baroclinic), direct and inverse energy cascades are possible. The pathways toward dissipation of the dominant geostrophic eddy KE depend crucially on the direction of the cascade but are difficult to quantify because of serious observational difficulties for wavelengths shorte...},

Having been adopted by ESA in 1998, Vega will take 300 to 2000 kg payloads into polar and low-earth orbit. Vega consists of four stages, three of which are high-performance solid-propellant motors. The 1st stage, P80 FW, also serves to develop technology for future new generation boosters of Ariane5. As Vega is developed under full ESA responsibility, the ESTEC Structures Section TEC-MCS has been involved in various types of analyses of Vega from its early days. Initially using 2D models to describe the launcher's global behaviour, now also 3D models are available for dynamic analysis of events taking place from P80 ignition until payload separation. Due to their specific nature, accurate prediction of the ignition of solid-propellant motors requires a good understanding of phenomena taking place, lift-off from the launch table means a change in boundary conditions, thrust oscillations in the solid-propellant motors pose a challenge in stiffness/damping modelling, and the vehicle's immersion into aerodynamic disturbances demand realistic distributed aerodynamic coefficients in particular for transonic flight at Mach1. Based both on previous Ariane5 experience and specific characteristics of the Vega stages, forcing functions and procedures have been developed for low frequency dynamic analysis of the launcher and the payload.},

(Grilli et al. 2001 Int. J. Numer. Methods Fluids 35, 829–867), it uses a high-order three-dimensional boundary-element method combined with mixed Eulerian–Lagrangian time updating, based on second-order explicit Taylor expansions with adaptive time-steps. Such methods are known to be accurate but expensive. The efficiency of the code has been greatly improved by introducing the fast multipole algorithm. By replacing every matrix–vector product of the iterative solver and avoiding the building of the influence matrix, this algorithm reduces the computing complexity from to nearly , where N is the number of nodes on the boundary. The performance of the method is illustrated by the example of the overturning of a solitary wave over a three-dimensional sloping bottom. For this test case, the accelerated method is indeed much faster than the former one, even for quite coarse grids. For instance, a reduction of the complexity by a factor six is obtained for N=6022, for the same global accuracy. The acceleration of the code allows the study of more complex physical problems and several examples are presented.},

Employing this methodology, we analyse inviscid, irrotational, two-dimensional water waves in a bounded domain, and in particular we study the generation of waves by a moving piecewise horizontal bottom, as it occurs in tsunamis. We show that this problem is characterised by two equations which involve only first-order derivatives. It is argued that under the assumptions of 'small amplitude waves' but not of 'long waves', the above two equations can be treated numerically via a recently introduced numerical technique for elliptic partial differential equations in a polygonal domain. In the particular case that the moving bottom is horizontal and under the assumption of 'small amplitude waves', but not of 'long waves', these equations yield a non-local generalisation of the Boussinesq system. Furthermore, under the additional assumption of 'long waves' the above system yields a Boussinesq-type system, which however includes the effect of the moving boundary.},

 abstract = {a b s t r a c t Earlier studies have indicated that the gross nearshore wave energy resource is significantly smaller than the gross offshore wave energy resource implying that the deployment of wave energy converters in the nearshore is unlikely to be economic. However, it is argued that the gross wave energy resource is not an appropriate measure for determining the productivity of a wave farm and an alternative measure, the exploitable wave energy resource, is proposed. Calculation of a site's potential using the exploitable wave energy resource is considered superior because it accounts for the directional distribution of the incident waves and the wave energy plant rating that limits the power capture in highly energetic sea-states. A third-generation spectral wave model is used to model the wave transformation from deep water to a nearshore site in a water depth of 10 m. It is shown that energy losses result in a reduction of less than 10% of the net incident wave power. Annual wave data for the North Atlantic coast of Scotland is analysed and indicates that whilst the gross wave energy resource has reduced significantly by the 10 m depth contour, the exploitable wave energy resource is reduced by 7 and 22% for the two sites analysed. This limited reduction in exploitable wave energy resource means that for many exposed coasts, nearshore sites offer similar potential for exploitation of the wave energy resource as offshore sites.},

 abstract = {Many empirical and heuristic distribution functions for wave crest heights have been proposed, but their predictions differ considerably. Part of the lack of agreement is due to the difficulty of making measurements that accurately record the true height of the wave crests. Surface following buoys effectively cancel out the second-order nonlinearity by making a Lagrangian measurement. Pressure transducers filter the nonlinear com-ponents of the signal in complicated ways. Wave staffs have varying degrees of sensitivity to spray. The location of the instruments also plays an important role. There is clear evidence from measurements in the North Sea that spurious crests due to spray are a problem downwind even from mounting supports that appear transparent. Much of the theoretical nonlinearity can be captured by calculations correct to second order. Explicit calculation of the interactions of each pair of components in a directional spectrum is straightforward although computa-tionally intensive. This technique has the advantage that the effects of wave steepness, water depth, and directional spreading are included with no approximation other than the truncation of the expansion at second order. Comparisons with measurements that are believed to be of the best quality show good agreement with these second-order calculations. Simulations for a set of JONSWAP spectra then lead to parametric crest distributions, which can be used easily in applications.},

The algorithm outputs are the foot kinematic parameters, which include foot orientation, position, velocity, acceleration, and gait phase. The foot motion filtering algorithm incorporates methods for orientation estimation, gait detection, and position estimation. A novel Complementary Filter (CF) is introduced to better pre-process the sensor data from a foot-mounted IMU containing tri-axial angular rate sensors, accelerometers, and magnetometers and to estimate the foot orientation without resorting to GPS data. A gait detection is accomplished using a simple states detector that transitions between states based on acceleration measurements. Once foot orientation is computed, position estimates are obtained by using integrating acceleration and velocity data, which has been corrected at step stance phase for drift using an implemented ZVU algorithm, leading to a position accuracy improvement. We illustrate our findings experimentally by using of a commercial IMU during regular human walking trial in a typical public building.

During this emergency situation, an extremely hot and radioactive lava-like material, the corium, is generated by the melting of the fuel assembly. The corium may induce collapse of the nuclear reactor devices and, in the worst case, breach the reactor containment and escape into the environment. This work shows the capabilities of the proposed formulation to reproduce the structural failure mechanisms induced by the corium that may occur during a meltdown scenario. For this purpose, a monolithic method for FSI problems, the so-called Unified formulation, is here enhanced in order to account for the thermal field and to model phase change phenomena with the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM). Several numerical examples are presented. First, the convergence of the thermo-coupled method and phase change algorithm is shown for two academic problems. Then, two complex simulations of hypothetical nuclear meltdown situations are studied in 2D as in 3D.},

Numerical modeling is done within a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework developed in Valizadeh and Rudman (2017). For each $\epsilon$ value, we have compared the experimental and numerical results in terms of the free surface profiles and the phase speeds to give recommendations for the solitary wave solution and the generation methodology that demonstrates the best performance.

 abstract = {Evaluation routines are essential for any application that uses triangular B-spline surfaces. This paper describes an algorithm to efficiently evaluate triangular B-spline surfaces with arbitrary many variables. The novelty of the algorithm is its generality: there is no restriction on the degree of the B-spline surfaces or on the dimension of the domain. Constructing an evaluation graph allows us to reuse partial results and hence, to decrease computation time. Computation time gets reduced even more by making choices in unfolding the recurrence relation of simplex splines such that the evaluation graph becomes smaller. The complexity of the algorithm is measured by the number of leaves of the graph.},

 abstract = {Regular wave-induced behaviour of a floating stationary two-dimensional body with a moonpool is studied. The focus is on resonant piston-mode motion in the moonpool and rigid-body motions. Dedicated two-dimensional experiments have been performed. Two numerical hybrid methods, which have previously been applied to related problems, are further developed. Both numerical methods couple potential and viscous flow. The semi-nonlinear hybrid method uses linear free-surface and body-boundary conditions. The other one uses fully nonlinear free-surface and body-boundary conditions. The harmonic polynomial cell method solves the Laplace equation in the potential flow domain, while the finite volume method solves the Navier-Stokes equations in the viscous flow domain near the body. Results from the two codes are compared with the experimental data. The nonlinear hybrid method compares well with the data, while certain discrepancies are observed for the semi-nonlinear method. In particular, the roll motion is over-predicted by the semi-nonlinear hybrid method. Error sources in the semi-nonlinear hybrid method are discussed. The moonpool strongly affects heave motions in a frequency range around the piston-mode resonance frequency of the moonpool. No resonant water motions occur in the moonpool at the piston-mode resonance frequency. Instead large moonpool motions occur at a heave natural frequency associated with small damping near the piston-mode resonance frequency.},

@article{Freeman1980,
 abstract = {This chapter focuses on soliton interactions in two dimensions. The word “soliton” was coined around 1965 by Zabusky and Kruskal to describe solitary wave pulses, which they observed while numerically integrating a nonlinear partial differential equation—the so-called Kortewegde Vries (K-de V) equation. The solitary wave solution of this equation has been known for many years. The derivation of one of the fundamental equations of soliton theory was given by Korteweg and de Vries in their famous paper of 1895. The equation describes the amplitude of long one-dimensional waves on the surface of a fluid. In physical terms, the effects included in the equation are weak, nonlinearity, and dispersion. The extension of this equation to motions in more than one dimension were given by Kadomtsev and Petviashvili, who generalized the dispersion relation to give an extra term in the equation due to the extra dimension. This chapter elaborates Korteweg-de Vries equation and two-soliton interactions. Inverse Scattering theory is described. A discussion on positive dispersion and the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation is also presented. {\textcopyright} 1980, Academic Press Inc.},

This measure is constructed from the condition number of the linear transformation between a unit equilateral tetrahedron and any tetrahedron with positive volume. Using this shape measure, we formulate two optimization objective functions that are differentiated by their goal: the first seeks to improve the average quality of the tetrahedral mesh; the second aims to improve the worst-quality element in the mesh. We review the optimization techniques used with each objective function and present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the mesh improvement methods. We show that a combined optimization approach that uses both objective functions obtains the best-quality meshes for several complex geometries.

The wind was dynamically downscaled from the ERA-Interim reanalysis to a 2.5 km horizontal resolution and 65 vertical levels, using the HARMONIE meso-scale model. The wave hindcast was derived using WAVEWATCH III on an unstructured grid with resolution ranging between 10 km offshore and 225 m in the nearshore, forced by the downscaled HARMONIE 10 m winds and ERA-Interim wave spectra. The wind and wave hindcasts were thoroughly validated against available buoy data, including wave buoys in nearshore locations and coastal synoptic stations. In addition, the significant wave heights and winds from the hindcasts were compared against all available altimeter data from the CERSAT database at Ifremer. The quality of both the wind and wave hindcasts was found to be good.The wave and wind energy resource in coastal areas was assessed, and discussed in terms of water depth, distance to shore, and seasonal and inter-annual variability. In addition, the current study investigates the nearshore wind and wave climate in conjunction with each other, and highlights two issues with relevance to the ocean renewable energy industry: (i) the complementarity between the wind and wave energy resource, and (ii) the accessibility for marine operations. Our study highlights sites around the Irish coast that might have been overlooked in terms of the potential for wind, wave or combined wind/wave energy installations.},

The numerical model is based on a three-dimensional mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian (MEL) method under certain simplifying approximations permitting Rankine panel scheme to be implemented over a time-invariant boundary surface to solve the boundary value problem for the unknown velocity potentials. A 4th order Adams-Bashforth-Moulton scheme is used for time marching of rigid-body motion histories of the individual bodies and evolution of the free-surface including the gap region in which large resonant fluid motions occur. A systematic study has been carried out to evaluate the performance of the developed time domain method in simulating the forces and motions as well as the fluid motion in the gap region for the two body system under various arrangements and in different wave-headings. At first, the computed numerical results have been validated and verified with computational and experimental results available in literature for standard geometries such as vertical truncated cylinders and rectangular boxes. Secondly, effectiveness of the damping lid model which is introduced to suppress wave resonance in the gap region is investigated including its influence on maximum sway forces on fixed and floating rectangular barges in side-by-side configurations. Thirdly, comparative studies on absolute and relative motion response for two cases (two rectangular barges, and a FLNG-FPSO + shuttle tanker) in side-by-side arrangement are detailed to bring out the importance of nonlinearities arising due to steep nonlinear incident waves. Finally, coupled motions of the two-body system of an FPSO and a shuttle tanker floating in side-by-side configuration in a steep nonlinear wave field are studied in which the two bodies are connected through hawsers, and also the FPSO is moored to the ground. Additionally there is a fender between the two bodies.},

 abstract = {Resin Transfer Molding is widely used to produce fiber-reinforced materials. In the process, the resin enters a close mold containing the dry fiber preform. For mold designer, numerical simulation is a useful tool to optimize the mold filling, in particular to identify the best positions of the ports and the vents. An issue in mold filling simulation is the front tracking, because the shape of the resin front changes during the flow. In particular, topological changes can appear resulting from internal obstacles dividing the front or multi-injection. A previous approach [1] using the Boundary Element Method (BEM) in a moving mesh framework shows the capability of the method to compute accuratlely the front propagation at low CPU time. The present paper describes a method developed to handle complex shapes, using BEM together with a Level Set approach. Numerical results in two dimensions are presented, assuming a Newtonian non-reactive fluid, and an homogeneous and not-deformable reinforcement. The resin flow in the fibrous reinforcement is modeled using Darcy's law and mass conservation. The resulting equation reduces to Laplace's equation considering an isotropic equivalent mold. Laplaces equation is solved at each time step using a constant Boundary Element Method to compute the normal velocity at the flow front. It is extended to the fixed grid and next used to feed a Level Set solver computing the signed distance to the front. Our model includes a boundary element mesher and a Narrow Band method to speed up CPU time. The numerical model is compared with an analytical solution, a FEM/VOF-based simulation and experimental measurements for more realistic cases involving multiple injection ports and internal obstacles. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag France.},

 abstract = {The effects of surface roughness on the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a flexible cylinder have been studied experimentally. The drag, lift, tension, vortex-shedding frequency, vibration frequency, and displacement response of cylinders with different roughnesses are compared. The results indicate that a pure VIV lock-in phenomenon occurs in the in-line direction earlier than in the cross-flow direction, and thus the VIV response in the in-line direction is larger than in the cross-flow direction in the low-reduced-velocity range. The tension in the cylinder has two peak frequencies. One peak is the dominant frequency, which coincides with the dominant frequency of the drag and is induced by the VIV in the in-line direction. The other peak is at half of the dominant frequency, at the dominant frequency of the lift; it is caused by the VIV in the cross-flow direction. Rough cylinders have a smaller displacement response, a narrower lock-in region, and a higher vortex-shedding frequency than a smooth cylinder.},

 abstract = {We report a case of somatic APC mosaicism in an person with a clinical diagnosis of Gardner syndrome with features of attenuated polyposis coli and with an uninformative family history. In initial screening for APC mutations, the germline mutation E1573X was detected in a lower proportion than that predicted by a heterozygous mutation indicating the presence of somatic mosaicism. Pyrosequencing confirmed this hypothesis and quantified the presence of the mutation in approximately 18% of the blood lymphocytes. Mutational analysis performed in the offspring revealed a fully heterozygous E1573X mutation in 2 of the 3 individuals tested. The milder colonic phenotype exhibited by the index patient could be a consequence of the presence of the mosaicism in the colon mucosa. The detection of the mutation in other tissues and in the offspring suggests that it may have occurred early during embryogenesis, before the separation of the embryonic layers. The E1573X mutation is the most distal mutation in the APC sequence reported to date as a mosaic and, interestingly, in the context of Gardner syndrome with extensive extracolonic features. Mosaicism is an important consequence of de novo APC mutations and it should be considered in the management of apparently sporadic or de novo cases, particularly in the evaluation of the risk of siblings and offspring.},

 abstract = {A novel Kernel Derivative-Free (KDF) Weakly-Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH) model is developed for simulation of free-surface flows and convection heat transfer. A high-order Laplacian operator is developed and then applied for the approximation of the diffusion terms (e.g., viscous term, thermal diffusion, and newly additional diffusion term in the continuity equation). The transient term in Navier–Stokes equation is discretized using the third-order TVD Runge-Kutta scheme, while a stiff equation of state is employed to predict pressure field. To increase numerical accuracy, a new high-order smoothing operator in the context of the MPS description (Moving Particle Semi-implicit) is also proposed and then applied for the treatment of the buoyancy force term in the momentum equation. Furthermore, a new high-order smoothing kernel is constructed and tested via simulation of the 1D Sod shock tube problem. A series of numerical benchmark cases such as: dam break, stretching of a circular water drop, rotating square patch of fluid and natural convection heat transfer in a square enclosure are used to verify and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed models. It is found that all simulation results are in excellent agreement with the available experimental and numerical data. Capability and performance of KDF-WCSPH method in handling particulate flows with thermal convection are further demonstrated through analysis of entropy generation due to natural convection heat transfer in the three different well-known geometries including: Differentially Heated Cavity, L-shaped enclosure and horizontal annuli. Comparison with the past Finite-Volume results demonstrates that the present model can maintain stability and accuracy, which makes it a very useful tool for simulation of thermo-hydraulic problems.},

We will show that this property can be obtained by reducing the support of basis functions defined on coarse grids, according to finer levels in the hierarchy of splines. This truncation not only decreases the overlapping of supports related to basis functions arising from different hierarchical levels, but it also improves the numerical properties of the corresponding hierarchical basis - which is denoted as truncated hierarchical B-spline (THB-spline) basis. Several computed examples will illustrate the adaptive approximation behavior obtained by using a refinement algorithm based on THB-splines. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {The problem of constructing a normalized hierarchical basis for adaptively refined spline spaces is addressed. Multilevel representations are defined in terms of a hierarchy of basis functions, reflecting different levels of refinement. When the hierarchical model is constructed by considering an underlying sequence of bases {$\Gamma$ℓ}ℓ=0,{\ldots},N−1 with properties analogous to classical tensor-product B-splines, we can define a set of locally supported basis functions that form a partition of unity and possess the property of coefficient preservation, i.e., they preserve the coefficients of functions represented with respect to one of the bases $\Gamma$ℓ. Our construction relies on a certain truncation procedure, which eliminates the contributions of functions from finer levels in the hierarchy to coarser level ones. Consequently, the support of the original basis functions defined on coarse grids is possibly reduced according to finer levels in the hierarchy. This truncation mechanism not only decreases the overlapping of basis supports, but it also guarantees strong stability of the construction. In addition to presenting the theory for the general framework, we apply it to hierarchically refined tensor-product spline spaces, under certain reasonable assumptions on the given knot configuration.},

@article{Giannopoulou2019,
 abstract = {In the present paper, a Vortex Particle Method is combined with a Boundary Element Method for the study of viscous incompressible planar flow around solid bodies. The method is based on Chorins operator splitting approach for the Navier–Stokes equations written in vorticity–velocity formulation, and consists of an advection step followed by a diffusion step. The evaluation of the advection velocity exploits the Helmholtz–Hodge Decomposition, while the no-slip condition is enforced by an indirect boundary integral equation. The above decomposition and splitting are discussed in comparison to the analogous decomposition for the pressure-velocity formulation of the governing equations. The Vortex Particle Method is implemented with a completely meshless algorithm, as neither advection nor diffusion requires topological connection of the point lattice. The results of the meshless approach are compared with those obtained by a mesh-based Finite Volume Method, where the pseudo-compressible iteration is exploited to enforce the solenoidal constraint on the velocity field. Several benchmark tests were performed for verification and validation purposes. In particular, we analyzed the two-dimensional flow past a circle, past an ellipse with incidence and past a triangle for different Reynolds numbers.},

@article{Gibbs2020,
 abstract = { We present a hybrid numerical-asymptotic (HNA) boundary element method (BEM) for high frequency scattering by two-dimensional screens and apertures, whose computational cost to achieve any prescribed accuracy remains bounded with increasing frequency. Our method is a collocation implementation of the high order hp HNA approximation space of Hewett et al. (IMA J Numer Anal 35:1698–1728, 2015), where a Galerkin implementation was studied. An advantage of the current collocation scheme is that the one-dimensional highly oscillatory singular integrals appearing in the BEM matrix entries are significantly easier to evaluate than the two-dimensional integrals appearing in the Galerkin case, which leads to much faster computation times. Here we compute the required integrals at frequency-independent cost using the numerical method of steepest descent, which involves complex contour deformation. The change from Galerkin to collocation is nontrivial because naive collocation implementations based on square linear systems suffer from severe numerical instabilities associated with the numerical redundancy of the HNA basis, which produces highly ill-conditioned BEM matrices. In this paper we show how these instabilities can be removed by oversampling, and solving the resulting overdetermined collocation system in a weighted least-squares sense using a truncated singular value decomposition. On the basis of our numerical experiments, the amount of oversampling required to stabilise the method is modest (around 25% typically suffices), and independent of frequency. As an application of our method we present numerical results for high frequency scattering by prefractal approximations to the middle-third Cantor set. },

@article{Gibouin2018,
 abstract = {A robotic fish is used to test the validity of a simplification made in the context of fish locomotion. With this artificial aquatic swimmer, we verify that the momentum equation results from a simple balance between a thrust and a drag that can be treated independently in the small amplitude regime. The thrust produced by the flexible robot is proportional to A2f2, where A and f are the respective tail-beat amplitude and oscillation frequency, irrespective of whether or not f coincides with the resonant frequency of the fish. The drag is proportional to U02, where U0 is the swimming velocity. These three physical quantities set the value of the Strouhal number in this regime. For larger amplitudes, we found that the drag coefficient is not constant but increases quadratically with the fin amplitude. As a consequence, the achieved locomotion velocity decreases, or the Strouhal number increases, as a function of the fin amplitude.},

 abstract = {In this work, we model extreme waves that oc-cur due to Mach reflection through the intersection of two obliquely incident solitary waves. For a given range of in-cident angles and amplitudes, the Mach stem wave grows linearly in length and amplitude, reaching up to 4 times the amplitude of the incident waves. A variational approach is used to derive the bidirectional Benney–Luke equations, an asymptotic equivalent of the three-dimensional potential-flow equations modelling water waves. This nonlinear and weakly dispersive model has the advantage of allowing wave propagation in two horizontal directions, which is not the case with the unidirectional Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (KP) equation used in most previous studies. A variational Galerkin finite-element method is applied to solve the sys-tem numerically in Firedrake with a second-order St{\"{o}}rmer– Verlet temporal integration scheme, in order to obtain stable simulations that conserve the overall mass and energy of the system. Using this approach, we are able to get close to the 4-fold amplitude amplification predicted by Miles.},

@article{Gobbi2000,
 abstract = {For pt.1 see G. Wei et al., ibid., vol. 294, p.71-92 (1995). A Boussinesq-type model is derived which is accurate to O(kh)4 and which retains the full representation of the fluid kinematics in nonlinear surface boundary condition terms, by not assuming weak nonlinearity. The model is derived for a horizontal bottom, and is based explicitly on a fourth-order polynomial representation of the vertical dependence of the velocity potential. In order to achieve a (4,4) Pade representation of the dispersion relationship, a new dependent variable is defined as a weighted average of the velocity potential at two distinct water depths. The representation of internal kinematics is greatly improved over existing O(kh)2 approximations, especially in the intermediate to deep water range. The model equations are first examined for their ability to represent weakly nonlinear wave evolution in intermediate depth. Using a Stokes-like expansion in powers of wave amplitude over water depth, we examine the bound second harmonics in a random sea as well as nonlinear dispersion and stability effects in the nonlinear Schrodinger equation for a narrow-banded sea state. We then examine numerical properties of solitary wave solutions in shallow water, and compare the model performance to the full solution of Tanaka (1986) as well as the level 1, 2 and 3 solutions of Shields and Webster (1988)},

 abstract = {The various aspects of the propagation of long waves onto a shelf (i.e., reflection, transmission and propagation on the shelf) are exa$\sim$mined experimentally and theoretically. The results are applied to tsunamis propagating onto the continental shelf. A .numerical method of solving the one-dimensional Boussinesq equations for constant depth using finite element techniques is presentled. The method is extended to the case of an arbitrary variation in depth (i.e., gradually to abruptly varying depth) in the dirlection of wave propagation. The scheme is applied to the propagation of solitary waves over a slope onto a shelf and is confirm$\sim$ed by experiments. A theory is developed for the generation in the laboratory of long waves of permanent form, i.e., solitary and cnoidal waves. The theory, which incorporates the nonlinear aspects of the problem, applies to wave generators which consist of a vertical plate which moves h$\sim$orizontally. Experiments have been conducted and the results agree well with the generation theory. In addition, these results are used to compare the shape, celerity and damping characteristics of the generated waves with the long wave theories. The solution of the linear nondispersive theory for harmonic waves of a single frequency propagating over a slope onto a shelf is extended to the case of solitary waves. Comparisons of this analysis with the nonlinear dispersive theory and experiments are presented. Co$\sim$nparisons of experiments with solitary and cnoidal waves with the predictions of the various theories indicate that, apart from propagation, the reflection of waves from a change in depth is a linear process except in extreme cases. However, the transmission and the propagation of both the transmitteid and the reflected waves in general are nonlinear processes. Exceptions are waves with heights which aire very small compared to the depth. For these waves, the entire process of propagation onto a shelf in the vicinity of the shelf is linear. Tsunamis propagating from the deep ocean onto the continental shelf probably fall. in chis class.},

 abstract = {In 2011 the DeepCwind Consortium, led by the University of Maine (UMaine), performed an extensive series of floating wind turbine model tests at the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN) offshore basin. These tests, which were conducted at 1/50th scale, investigated the response of three floating wind turbine concepts subjected to simultaneous wind and wave environments. The wind turbine blades utilized for the tests were geometrically-similar models of those found on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5 MW reference wind turbine and performed poorly in the Froudescaled, low-Reynolds number wind environment. As such, the primary aerodynamic load produced by the wind turbine, thrust, was drastically lower than expected for a given Froude-scaled wind speed. In order to obtain appropriate mean thrust forces for conducting the global performance testing of the floating wind turbines, the winds speeds were substantially raised beyond the target Froude-scale values. While this correction yielded the desired mean thrust load, the sensitivities of the thrust force due to changes in the turbine inflow wind speed, whether due to wind gusts or platform motion, were not necessarily representative of the full-scale system. In hopes of rectifying the wind turbine performance issue for Froude-scale wind/wave basin testing, efforts have been made by UMaine, Maine Maritime Academy and MARIN to design performance-matched wind turbines that produce the correct thrust forces when subjected to Froude-scale wind environments. In this paper, an improved, performancematched wind turbine is mounted to the DeepCwind semisubmersible platform investigated in 2011 (also studied in the International Energy Association's OC4 Phase II Project) and retested in MARIN's offshore basin with two major objectives: 1) To demonstrate that the corrective wind speed adjustments made in the earlier DeepCwind tests produced realistic global performance behaviors and 2) To illustrate the increased capability for simulating full-scale floating wind turbine responses that a performance-matched turbine has over the earlier, geometrically-similar design tested. As an example of this last point, this paper presents select results for coupled wind/wave tests with active blade pitch control made possible with the use of a performance-matched wind turbine. The results of this paper show that the earlier DeepCwind tests produced meaningful data; however, this paper also illustrates the immense potential of using a performance-matched wind turbine in wind/wave basin model tests for floating wind turbines.},

 abstract = {Beyond many of Earth's coasts exists a vast deepwater wind resource that can be tapped to provide substantial amounts of clean, renewable energy. However, much of this resource resides in waters deeper than 60m where current fixed bottom wind turbine technology is no longer economically viable. As a result, many are looking to floating wind turbines as a means of harnessing this deepwater offshore wind resource. The preferred floating platform technology for this application, however, is currently up for debate. To begin the process of assessing the unique behavior of various platform concepts for floating wind turbines, 1/50th scale model tests in a wind/wave basin were performed at the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN) of three floating wind turbine concepts. The Froude scaled tests simulated the response of the 126m rotor diameter National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) 5 MW, horizontal axis Reference Wind Turbine attached via a flexible tower in turn to three distinct platforms, these being a tension leg-platform, a spar-buoy, and a semisubmersible. A large number of tests were performed ranging from simple free-decay tests to complex operating conditions with irregular sea states and dynamic winds. The high-quality wind environments, unique to these tests, were realized in the offshore basin via a novel wind machine, which exhibited low swirl and turbulence intensity in the flow field. Recorded data from the floating wind turbine models include rotor torque and position, tower top and base forces and moments, mooring line tensions, six-axis platform motions, and accelerations at key locations on the nacelle, tower, and platform. A comprehensive overview of the test program, including basic system identification results, is covered in previously published works. In this paper, the results of a comprehensive data analysis are presented, which illuminate the unique coupled system behavior of the three floating wind turbines subjected to combined wind and wave environments. The relative performance of each of the three systems is discussed with an emphasis placed on global motions, flexible tower dynamics, and mooring system response. The results demonstrate the unique advantages and disadvantages of each floating wind turbine platform. {\textcopyright} 2014 by ASME.},

 abstract = {Using the Hamiltonian approach of Krasitskii (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 272, 1994, pp. 1–20), we derive a variant of the Zakharov equation in which the wave-induced mean surface elevation and the surface potential of the wave-induced mean flow are represented as separate variables governed by separate evolution equations. The kernel function of this new variant is simpler, and in particular also well defined in the uniform-wave-train limit for waves on finite depth. This form of the Zakharov equation may be advantageous in some applications. One example is the derivation of nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equations in the narrow-band limit, where the handling of the mean flow and mean surface is significantly simpler than when starting from the original Zakharov equation. In this paper we have used the alternative form of the Zakharov equation to derive a Hamiltonian nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation for directional waves on arbitrary depth, valid to one order higher in bandwidth than the Hamiltonian equation recently presented by Craig, Guyenne and Sulem (Wave Motion, vol. 47, 2010, pp. 552–563).},

 abstract = {Droplets move on substrates with a spatio-temporal wettability pattern as generated, for example, on light-switchable surfaces. To study such cases, we implement the boundary-element method to solve the governing Stokes equations for the fluid flow field inside and on the surface of a droplet and supplement it by the Cox-Voinov law for the dynamics of the contact line. Our approach reproduces the relaxation of an axisymmetric droplet in experiments, which we initiate by instantaneously switching the uniform wettability of a substrate quantified by the equilibrium contact angle. In a step profile of wettability the droplet moves towards higher wettability. Using a feedback loop to keep the distance or offset between step and droplet center constant, induces a constant velocity with which the droplet surfs on the wettability step. We analyze the velocity in terms of droplet offset and step width for typical wetting parameters. Moving instead the wettability step with constant speed, we determine the maximally possible droplet velocities under various conditions. The observed droplet speeds agree with the values from the feedback study for the same positive droplet offset.},

 abstract = {The numerical model for nonlinear wave propagation in the physical space, developed by Grilli, et al.12,13, uses a higher-order BEM for solving Laplace's equation, and a higher-order Taylor expansion for integrating in time the two nonlinear free surface boundary conditions. The corners of the fluid domain were modelled by double-nodes with imposition of potential continuity. Nonlinear wave generation, propagation and runup on slopes were successfully studied with this model. In some applications, however, the solution was found to be somewhat inaccurate in the corners and this sometimes led to wave instability after propagation in time. In this paper, global and local accuracy of the model are improved by using a more stable free surface representation based on quasi-spline elements and an improved corner solution combining the enforcement of compatibility relationships in the double-nodes with an adaptive integration which provides almost arbitrary accuracy in the BEM numerical integrations. These improvements of the model are systematically checked on simple examples with analytical solutions. Effects of accuracy of the numerical integrations, convergence with refined discretization, domain aspect ratio in relation with horizontal and vertical grid steps, are separately assessed. Global accuracy of the computations with the new corner solution is studied by solving nonlinear water wave flows in a two-dimensional numerical wavetank. The optimum relationship between space and time discretization in the model is derived from these computations and expressed as an optimum Courant number of ∼0.5. Applications with both exact constant shape waves (solitary waves) and overturning waves generated by a piston wavemaker are presented in detail. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

An improved numerical treatment of the boundary conditions at the intersection between moving lateral boundaries and the free surface (corner) is implemented and tested in the model, and the free surface interpolation method is also improved to better model highly curved regions of the free surface that occur in breaking waves. Finally, a node regridding technique is introduced to improve the resolution of the solution close to moving boundaries and in breaker jets.\nExamples are presented for solitary wave propagation, shoaling, and breaking over a 1:35 slope and for wave breaking induced by a moving vertical boundary. Using the new methods, both resolution and extent of computations are significantly improved compared to the earlier model, for similar computational efforts. In all cases computations can be carried out up to impact of the breaker jets on the free surface.},

The model solves fully non-linear potential flow equations with a free surface using a higher-order three-dimensional boundary element method (BEM) and a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian time updating, based on second-order explicit Taylor series expansions with adaptive time steps. The model is applicable to non-linear wave transformations from deep to shallow water over complex bottom topography up to overturning and breaking. Arbitrary waves can be generated in the model, and reflective or absorbing boundary conditions specified on lateral boundaries. In the BEM, boundary geometry and field variables are represented by 16-node cubic 'sliding' quadrilateral elements, providing local inter-element continuity of the first and second derivatives. Accurate and efficient numerical integrations are developed for these elements. Discretized boundary conditions at intersections (corner/edges) between the free surface or the bottom and lateral boundaries are well-posed in all cases of mixed boundary conditions. Higher-order tangential derivatives, required for the time updating, are calculated in a local curvilinear co-ordinate system, using 25-node 'sliding' fourth-order quadrilateral elements. Very high accuracy is achieved in the model for mass and energy conservation. No smoothing of the solution is required, but regridding to a higher resolution can be specified at any time over selected areas of the free surface. Applications are presented for the propagation of numerically exact solitary waves. Model properties of accuracy and convergence with a refined spatio-temporal discretization are assessed by propagating such a wave over constant depth. The shoaling of solitary waves up to overturning is then calculated over a 1:15 plane slope, and results show good agreement with a two-dimensional solution proposed earlier. Finally, three-dimensional overturning waves are generated over a 1:15 sloping bottom having a ridge in the middle, thus focusing wave energy. The node regridding method is used to refine the discretization around the overturning wave. Convergence of the solution with grid size is also verified for this case.

 abstract = {This research deals with the validation of fluid dynamic models, used for simulating shoaling and breaking solitary waves on slopes, based on experiments performed at the Ecole Sup{\'{e}}rieure d'Ing{\'{e}}nieurs de Marseille's (ESIM) laboratory. A separate paper, also presented at this conference, reports on experiments. In a first part of this work, a fully nonlinear potential flow model based on a Boundary Element Method (BEM) developed at the University of Rhode Island (URI), is used to generate and propagate solitary waves over a slope, up to overturning, in a set-up closely reproducing the laboratory tank geometry and wavemaker system. The BEM model uses a boundary integral equation method for the solution of governing potential flow equations and an explicit Lagrangian time stepping for time integration. In a second part, several Navier-Stokes (NS) models, developed respectively at TREFLE-ENSCPB, IMFT, IRPHE and LSEET are initialized based on the BEM solution and used for modeling breaking solitary waves in a finely discretized region encompassing the top of the slope and the surfzone. The NS models are based on the Volume of Fluid Method (VOF). This paper mostly deals with the first part, which includes calibration and comparison of BEM results with experiments, for the generation of solitary waves in the physical wave tank. Thus, parameters of the physical wave tank were numerically matched, including tank geometry and motion of the wavemaker paddle corresponding to the generation of solitary waves. Use and coupling of the BEM and VOF models for the simulation of solitary wave breaking is discussed in the 306 paper.

 abstract = {Very long waves are generated when a ship moves across an appreciable depth change $\unicode[STIX]{x0394}h$ comparable to the average and relatively shallow water depth $h$ at the location, with $\unicode[STIX]{x0394}h/h\simeq 1$ . The phenomenon is new and the waves were recently observed in the Oslofjord in Norway. The 0.5–1 km long waves, extending across the 2–3 km wide fjord, are observed as run-ups and run-downs along the shore, with periods of 30–60 s, where a wave height up to 1.4 m has been measured. The waves travelling with the shallow water speed, found ahead of the ships moving at subcritical depth Froude number, behave like a mini-tsunami. A qualitative explanation of the linear generation mechanism is provided by an asymptotic analysis, valid for $\unicode[STIX]{x0394}h/h\ll 1$ and long waves, expressing the generation in terms of a pressure impulse at the depth change. Complementary fully dispersive calculations for $\unicode[STIX]{x0394}h/h\simeq 1$ document symmetries of the waves at positive or negative $\unicode[STIX]{x0394}h$ . The wave height grows with the ship speed $U$ according to $U^{n}$ with $n$ in the range 3–4, for $\unicode[STIX]{x0394}h/h\simeq 1$ , while the growth in $U$ is only very weak for $\unicode[STIX]{x0394}h/h\ll 1$ (the asymptotics). Calculations show good agreement with observations.},

@article{Gu2018,
 abstract = {Forced heave and surge motion of axisymmetric vertical cylindrical bodies with flat and rounded bases are simulated using the advanced CFD software STAR-CCM+ where the overset method is used so that the mesh local to the body moves within a stationary outer mesh. Viscous effects generating drag, and also influencing added mass and radiation damping, are determined. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations are adopted with different turbulence closure models and the water surface is captured by the volume of fluid (VOF) method. These results are of basic interest but the main motive is to assess appropriate drag coefficients for use with linear diffraction models of wave energy converters (WEC) and we have particular interest in the multi-body WEC M4. A basic dynamical model is set up so that drag, added mass and radiation damping coefficients may be obtained from the CFD results. Added mass and radiation damping coefficients were also obtained from the potential flow solver WAMIT for comparison. Mesh convergence studies were undertaken and while mesh independence was achieved for total force it was not possible for the very small shear force. In the laboratory a free heave decay test was undertaken without mechanical contact for bodies with rounded bases and the inferred drag and added mass coefficients were very close to those from CFD. Some general observations are possible for motion in heave. For the hemispherical base the drag coefficient Cd is very low for small amplitudes but this increases as amplitude is increased. For the rounded base with a flat central area the Cd is larger and for the wholly flat base it is larger again but with values less than 0.35. For a larger geometric scale (times 32) for the hemisphere and round base cases the Cd are generally somewhat reduced. For surge motion the Cd show less variation and are always greater than heave values by at least a factor of 2 which is indicative of effects due to separation and wake generation.},

In our modeling approach, an existing two-dimensional Numerical Wave Tank (NWT), based on potential flow theory, is extended to include a submerged horizontal cylinder of arbitrary cross-section. The mathematical problem and related numerical solution are first introduced. Then, conservation of volume and conservation of energy are checked, respectively, in the case of a circular cylinder in a prescribed large amplitude motion and in the case of a circular cylinder in a free motion. Interactions between waves and a submerged circular cylinder computed by the model are then compared to mathematical solutions for two situations: a cylinder in prescribed motion and a freely moving cylinder.},

The focus of this study is on second-order wave loads; therefore, first- and second-order wave loads are applied to a structure sequentially for a detailed comparison and a more precise analysis of the effects of the second-order loads. aNySIM does not have the capability to model flexible bodies, so the simulations performed in this tool are done assuming a rigid body. FAST also assumes that the platform is rigid but can account for the flexibility of the tower. The second objective is to study the effects of the second-order loads on the response of a tension-leg platform (TLP) floating wind turbine. The flexibility of the tower must be considered for this investigation; therefore, only FAST is used.},

Gyroscopes can offset such drawbacks but have data drifting problems. This paper presents a study on complementary and Kalman filter for tilting measurement using MEMS based IMU. The complementary filter algorithm uses low-pass filter and high-pass filter to deal with the data from accelerometer and gyroscope while Kalman filter takes the tilting angle and gyroscope bias as system states, combining the angle derived from the accelerometer to estimate the tilting angle. The study carried out both static and dynamic experiments. The results showed that both Complementary and Kalman filter were less sensitive to variations and almost no signal coupling phenomenon and able to obtain smooth and accurate results.},

Experimental analysis has traditionally been used to study these problems, but using computational modelling could potentially reduce the number of experimental iterations required. In this paper we investigate the use of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics as a method for modelling these problems and thus reducing the number of experiments required. Validation data is obtained from generic experiments that contain the important features of wave-structure interaction. A moored spherical buoy oscillating both through and across a free surface, as well as interacting with an incident sinusoidal wave train are discussed and companion SPH simulations are run. We show here that SPH is capable of achieving accurate predictions of the buoy's motion when interacting with the free surface with appropriate particle resolutions. An initial transient motion was observed in the experiments as a long period oscillation of the buoy at its surge natural frequency. This transient motion was also predicted by SPH, but at reduced amplitude. Overall SPH was determined to be a good choice for modelling surface and structure interactions and we provide guidelines on appropriate particle resolution for such interactions.},

In this paper, we introduce a new method for visually smooth interpolation of arbitrary triangle meshes based on a regular 4-split of the domain triangles. Ensuring tangent plane continuity of the surface is not enough for producing an overall fair shape. Interpolation of irregular control-polygons, be that in 1D or in 2D, often yields unwanted undulations. Note that this undulation problem is not particular to parametric interpolation, but also occurs with interpolatory subdivision surfaces. Our new method avoids unwanted undulations by relaxing the constraint of the first derivatives at the input mesh vertices: The tangent directions of the boundary curves at the mesh vertices are now completely free. Irregular triangulations can be handled much better in the sense that unwanted undulations due to flat triangles in the mesh are now avoided.},

 abstract = {　The Secondary Interactions of Surface Waves are treated in two roughly divided case. In Part Ⅰ, the case in which the first order wave has discrete components is discussed, and in Part Ⅱ th case in which it make the continuous spectrum is computed.
In Part Ⅰ, the main characteristics of the secondary interaction are treated in the one-dimensional problem . They include the case in which the each components of wave have the same direction of progress and the case in which their directions are opposite interaction is obtained, and as an example , the clapotis caused by the oblique incidence of progressive wave on the rigid wall is discussed.
In Part Ⅱ, we treat the wave which does not contain the progressive components. At first, the case of the one-dimensional wave in the finite depth is treated. Numerical results of the second order nonlinearity obtained by this method are in good agreement with the experimental nonlinear effect. Secondly the problem of the two-dimensional progressive wave in the finite depth is computed. A result of the simple application of this computation shows that, if the first order spectrum of wave profile has the sufficient angular spreading, the second order nonlinear components of frequency spectrum will be nonably different from those without angular spreading.},

 abstract = {In this paper, a fluid in a vessel is considered and large amplitude standing waves (LASW) of the fluid are simulated directly using the boundary element method (BEM). In the simulation, two problems come out. The first problem is that the energy of the LASW increases gradually when using double nodes at corners in the BEM. The second problem is that projection-like profiles appear near the point where the free surface meets the vessel wall when regridding is not used at each time step. These projection-like profiles are not physical and indicate numerical error, and cause the simulation to break down. We found that the use of discontinuous elements solves the first problem, and the use of the 'half shift technique' solves the second problem. In addition, a method called RIG for highly accurate simulation using regridding is proposed and verified. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {The paper discusses the generation of solitary waves using a piston wavemaker in the floor of the tank which can move only in a vertical direction. The paper notes that as the wavemaker moves verically upwards it can create a sotilary wave that is followed by a train of oscilating waves. However, when the piston moves vertically downwards only the oscilating wavetrain exists and there is no solitary wave. - The paper presents a model to predict the water surface elevation due to bed motion (wavemaker motion) using eigenfuncition expansion, and also gives an expression for the velocity potential of the fluid in eigenfunctions. - The autor's noticed that the characteristics of the wave greatly depened on the geometry and motion of the wavemaker. The acutor reported that there were two primary type of waves based on the motion of the wavemaker; 1) where the wavemaker's motion was that of a rapid impulse and the dimensionless time of the wavemaker's stroke (see page 787 section 5.4 for term) was much less than 1, and 2) when wavemaker's motion was gradual and the dimensionless time of the wavemaker's stroke is much greather than 1. For the impulsive bed motion (wavemaker motion) the wave profiles for bed motion of an exponential and half-sine form are similar suggesting that the wave profile is independent of the time-displacement history of the wave and is mostly dependent on the deformation of the bed. For the creeping bed motion the author reports that the waveform resembles the time-displacement history of the bed and is not influenced by the bed deformation. In fact the wave profiles for the creeping half-sine bed motion resemble the time-velocity history of the bed motion.},

 abstract = {Model equations which describe the evolution of long-wave initial data in water of uniform depth are tested to determine explicit criteria for their applicability. We consider linear and nonlinear, dispersive and non-dispersive equations. Separate criteria emerge for the leading wave and trailing oscillations of the evolving wave train. The evolution of the leading wave depends on two parameters: the volume (non-dimensional) of the initial data and an Ursell number based on the amplitude and length of the initial data. The magnitudes of these two parameters determine the appropriate model equation and its time of validity. For the trailing oscillatory waves, a local Ursell number based on the amplitude of the initial data and the local wavelength determines the appropriate model equation. Finally, these modelling criteria are applied to the problem of tsunami propagation. Asymptotic (t → ∞) linear dispersive theory does not appear to be applicable for describing the leading wave of tsunamis. If the length of the initial wave is approximately 100 miles, the leading wave is described by a linear non-dispersive model from the source region until shoaling occurs near the coastline. For smaller lengths (∼ 40 miles) a linear dispersive (but not asymptotic) model is applicable. The longer-period oscillatory waves following the leading wave, which can induce harbour resonance, apparently require a nonlinear dispersive model.},

 abstract = {Program in Applied Mathematics, University of Colorado, Boulder Periodic rip currents on a wide planar beach are generated in the laboratory by shoaling water waves that are periodic in time and in two spatial directions: one normal (x direction) and one parallel (y direction) to the shoreline. These short-crested waves propagate in water of uniform depth with nearly permanent form. They are described analytically by a family of solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation (KP solutions of genus 2). During shoaling, genus 2 waves retain their spatial pattern past breaking, and they quickly generate periodic rip currents along the beach with a spacing of one-half the y wavelength of the incident waves. KP theory also provides a plausible explanation and prediction for the narrow widths, relative to their longshore spacing, of rip currents generated in this manner. An estimate of their widths is one-half the x wavelength of the incident waves. Waves breaking on a sloping beach sometimes generate a periodic array of rip currents: narrow, intense seaward flows. These jetlike flows are dangerous to unsuspecting swimmers who may be swept seaward, and they can have a profound effect on the distribution of coastal sediments, pollutants, and other materials. Because of their importance, research on rip currents has a long-standing history (e.g., Shepard et al. [1941]; see Bowen [1969] and Komar [1976] for reviews). Periodic rip currents are generated by periodic longshore variability in the heights of incoming waves. (Rip currents occur in regions of lower wave heights.) Several mechanisms to account for periodic longshore variability have been proposed. These include bottom topography [Sonu, 1972], edge waves [Bowen and Inman, 1969; Hino, 1975], and obliquely intersecting incident waves [Branner, 1900; Dalrymple, 1975; Dalrymple and Lanan, 1976]. The analyses supporting these mechanisms are usually based on linearized equations, and none of the analyses address the narrowness of rip current widths, which accounts for their remarkable intensity. Arthur [1962] proposes a mechanism to explain the narrowing of rip currents as they flow off-shore; however, this mechanism explains neither the initial narrowness of rip currents nor their "blooming" observed further offshore.},

 abstract = {Recent studies have shown that by utilizing the interactions among median fins (the dorsal, anal, and caudal fins), fishes can achieve higher propulsion performance at the caudal fin. This work aims at a systematic study of the effects of dorsal/anal fin shape and flapping phase on the hydrodynamic performance due to median-fin interactions (MFI) in underwater propulsion using a three-dimensional bluegill sunfish model. Flow simulations were conducted on stationary Cartesian grids using an immersed-boundary-method-based incompressible Navier-Stokes flow solver. The results showed that, due to the collision between the posterior body vortices (PBVs) and caudal fin leading edge vortices (LEVs), the latter is strengthened. As a result, the thrust and efficiency of the caudal fin are improved simultaneously, by 25.6% and 29.2%, respectively. Increases in the dorsal/anal fin area result in stronger caudal fin LEVs, and thus further caudal fin performance enhancement. On the other hand, changing the dorsal/anal fin flapping phase affects the collision time between the PBVs and the LEVs, and results in caudal fin performance changes. Phase-leading dorsal and anal fins are found to improve caudal fin efficiency, whereas phase-lag dorsal and anal fins maintain caudal fin thrust at a higher level. Compared to trunk-synchronized dorsal and anal fins, 60° phase-leading dorsal and anal fins increase the propulsive efficiency of the caudal fin from 77.9% to 90.1%. In addition, it is found that the presence of the dorsal and anal fins greatly reduces drag on the fish body by preventing the PBVs from crossing the body midline and debilitating interactions between the left- and right-stroke PBVs. Results of this work improve our understanding of MFI in fishlike swimming and demonstrate the benefits of optimal MFI for the design of high-performance bioinspired underwater vehicles.},

The 4th-order Runge–Kutta scheme is adopted to update the free water surface boundary conditions expressed in a Lagrangian formulation. Following completion of the numerical model, the problems of radiation (heave) of water waves by a submerged sphere in finite depth are simulated and the computed results are verified against the published numerical results in order to ensure the effectiveness of the model. The validated numerical model is then applied to simulate the nonlinear wave radiation by a fully submerged vertical circular cylinder undergoing various forced sinusoidal motion in otherwise still conditions. The numerical results are obtained for a series of wave radiation problems; the completely submerged cylinder is placed in surging, heaving and combined heave-pitching motions with different drafts, amplitudes and frequencies. The corresponding numerical results of the cylinder motions, wave profiles, and hydrodynamic forces are then compared and explained for all the cases.},

 abstract = {We report on the development and validation of a new numerical wave tank (NWT) solving fully nonlinear potential flow (FNPF) equations, as a more efficient variation of Grilli et al.'s NWT [Grilli et al., A fully nonlinear model for three-dimensional overturning waves over arbitrary bottom. Int J Numer Methods Fluids. 2001; 35:829-867], which was successful at modeling many wave phenomena, including landslide-generated tsunamis, rogue waves, and the initiation of wave breaking over slopes. This earlier NWT combined a three dimensional MII (mid-interval interpolation) boundary element method (BEM) to an explicit mixed Eulerian–Lagrangian time integration. The latter was based on second-order Taylor series expansions for the mesh geometry and Dirichlet free surface boundary condition for the potential, requiring high-order derivatives to be computed in space and time. Here, to be able to solve large scale wave-structure interaction problems for surface-piercing bodies of complex geometry, of interest for ocean engineering and naval hydrodynamics applications, the NWT is reformulated to use cubic B-spline meshes and the BEM solution is accelerated with a parallelized fast multipole method (FMM) based on ExaFMM, one of the fastest open source FMM to date. The NWT accuracy, convergence, and scaling are first assessed for simple cases, by comparing results with those of the earlier MII-NWT as a function of mesh size and other model parameters. The relevance of the new NWT for solving the targeted applications is then demonstrated for surface piercing fixed cylinders, for which we show that results agree well with theoretical and experimental data for wave elevation and hydrodynamic forces.},

 abstract = {From the conditions of energy and momentum conservation it is shown that all four interaction coefficients of the elementary quadruple interactions discussed in Part I of this paper are equal. A further conservative quantity is then found which can be interpreted as the number density of the gravity-wave ensemble representing the random sea surface. The well-known analogy between a random linear wave field and a mass particle ensemble is found to hold also in the case of weak non-linear interactions in the wave field. The interaction conditions for energy transfer between waves to correspond to the equations of energy and momentum conservation for a particle collision, the final equation for the rate of change of the wave spectrum corresponding to Boltzmann's equation for the rate of change of the number density of an ensemble of colliding mass particles. The stationary wave spectrum corresponding to the Maxwell distribution for a mass particle ensemble is found to be degenerate.

We consider alternative methods using a matrix B Ε Rn×m and applying the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method to min ∥b - Abz∥2 or min ∥Bb - Bax∥2. We give a sufficient condition concerning B for the GMRES methods to give a least squares solution without breakdown for arbitrary b, for overdetermined, underdetermined, and possibly rank-deficient problems. We then give a convergence analysis of the GMRES methods as well as the CGLS method. Then, we propose using the robust incomplete factorization (RIF) for B. Finally, we show by numerical experiments on overdetermined and underdetermined problems that, for ill-conditioned problems, the GMRES methods with RIF give least squares solutions faster than the CGLS and LSQR methods with RIF, and are similar in performance to the reorthogonalized CGLS with RIF. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

 abstract = {Nonlinear numerical simulations on the interaction of waves with a vertical elastic plate are performed by a newly developed computer code based on the MEL (Mixed Eulerian Lagrangian) method. The time-dependent elastic deflection of a vertical plate is described by the mode-expansion method. An implicit boundary-condition method is developed to calculate the acceleration of the plate without evaluating the hydrodynamic force acting on it. The 4th-order Runge-Kutta scheme with uniform time step is applied for time marching in solving the coupled motions of an elastic plate and the fluid. A hybrid wave absorbing beach is installed to prevent the wave reflection from the end of the wave tank. With an initial condition that a plate is bent, illustrative results of numerical computation for the elevation of the free surface are compared with a corresponding linear analytical solution. The hydroelastic vibration of a vertical plate induced by an initial pulse type elevation of the free surface is also simulated. Finally, the effect of the plate stiffness and the edge condition at the top of plate on hydroelastic behavior is studied systematically. INTRODUCTIONHydroelasticity has received considerable attention by man y authors (e.g. Wu et al., 1995; Kashiwagi, 2001; Meylan, 2002; and Sturova, 2006, to name a few). A thin floating plate is one of the most well studied hydroelastic problems, because it models many physical applications, such as a VLFS (VeryLar ge Floating Structure), to be used for various purposes and a sea ice floe; reviews of their research are provided byKashiw agi (2000b) and Watanabe (2004) for the VLFS and Squire (2007) for the sea ice floe. Various solution methods have been developed to solve hydroelastic problems. Endo and Yago (1999) and Kashiwagi (2001) have developed a time-stepping procedure to compute time dependent elastic responses.},

 abstract = {The submerged horizontal plate (SHP) has been extensively studied as an open-type breakwater, and some research explored its potential as a wave energy converter. However, these two functionalities were seldom combined in the literature. In this study, a 2D numerical model solving the wave-SHP interaction was built by using the weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (WCSPH) method. The thin-walled boundary condition was verified through a dam-break impact case. The accuracy of wave profile and flow velocity calculations was validated by comparing with available experiments of solitary and regular waves interactions with SHPs. Comparison of the wave dynamic and flow dynamic between SHP and submerged step were made, which showed the advantages and disadvantages of the SHP. Then a parametric study of regular waves-fixed SHP interaction was conducted. Empirical formulas for the wave transmission coefficient and energy conversion efficiency were obtained by regressing numerical results using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Finally, a mathematical programming problem concerning the combined functionalities of SHP was established. Using the complex method, the optimal length and submergence of SHP regarding different emphases taken on the regular wave attenuation and energy utilization were solved. The results preliminarily demonstrated the potential application of SHP as a wave energy breakwater and provided reference on its parameter design, although this work was carried out in 2D and ignored the effects of energy convertor and piles on wave and flow patterns.},

 abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

 abstract = {The Southern Australian margin is one of the most energetic regions in the world suitable for the extraction of wave energy for electricity generation. We have produced a data set in which the deep-water wave energy resource for the region is described by three representative deep-water wave states, equivalent to the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the deep-water wave energy flux, derived from archives of the USA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WaveWatch III (NWW3) operational wave model. The Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) wave model is then applied along the full Southern Australian margin to propagate these representative wave states into the near-shore region to quantify the effects of shallow water processes such as refraction, shoaling, and bottom friction. The wave energy incident on the 25-m isobath (∼30-50 kW/m) is approximately 35%-50% less than the World Energy Council estimates of offshore wave energy but is approximately 20% greater than the energy observed from long-term buoy deployments on the midshelf. The latter discrepancy is attributed to an overestimation of significant wave height along the Southern Australian margin by the NWW3 model. The near-shore model applied in this study adequately simulates the attenuation of wave heights across the continental shelf when compared with estimates of wave height attenuation obtained from the Topex satellite altimeter. The attenuation of wave energy across the continental shelf reduces the estimates of offshore wave energy as given by the World Energy Council; however the wave energy resource incident on the Southern Australian margin remains considerable. We estimate that if 10% of the incident near-shore energy in this region, which is an ambitious target when conversion efficiency is considered, were converted to electricity, approximately 130 TW h/yr (one-half of Australia's total present-day electricity consumption) would be produced. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

 abstract = {Hot Springs Cove on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, Canada is an off-grid community of approximately 80 residents reliant on diesel fuelled electricity generation. Recent concerns with on site diesel based electricity generation have prompted interest in renewable alternatives, including wave energy. To help evaluate the feasibility of deploying ocean wave energy conversion technologies near Hot Springs Cove, a preliminary assessment of the area's near-shore wave energy resources was performed. A near-shore wave model, utilizing a transfer function approach, was used to estimate wave conditions from 2005 to 2013 at a 3h time-step. Spectral wave data from NOAA's Wavewatch3 model were used as model input boundary conditions. The wave spectra resulting from the near-shore model were parameterized to indicate the magnitude and frequency-direction distribution of energy within each sea-state. Yearly mean values as well as monthly variation of each of the spectral parameters are plotted to indicate the spatial variation of the wave climate. A site in 50m of water, appropriate for a 2-body point absorber, was selected based on a number of generic constraints and objectives. This site is used to illustrate the temporal variation of the spectral parameters within each month of the year. The average annual wave energy at the reference location is 31kW/m, with a minimum (maximum) monthly average of 7.5 (60.5) kW/m. The magnitude of this resource is significantly greater than other high profile sites in Europe such as the WaveHub and EMEC, and indicates that the Hot Springs Cove region may be a good candidate for wave energy development. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper calculates wave climate around Kyushu for ten years (2007–2016) using the Simulating WAves Nearshore model with an approximately 800 m high spatial and 1-h temporal resolution. The results reveal that the south side of Kyushu has more energetic waves than the north and the southeast has the strongest energy among neighboring seas of Kyushu.

@article{Holthuijsen2003,
 abstract = {Conventional spectral wave models, which are used to determine wave conditions in coastal regions, can account for all relevant processes of generation, dissipation and propagation, except diffraction. To accommodate diffraction in such models, a phase-decoupled refraction-diffraction approximation is suggested. It is expressed in terms of the directional turning rate of the individual wave components in the two-dimensional wave spectrum. The approximation is based on the mild-slope equation for refraction-diffraction, omitting phase information. It does therefore not permit coherent wave fields in the computational domain (harbours with standing-wave patterns are excluded). The third-generation wave model SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) was used for the numerical implementation based on a straightforward finite-difference scheme. Computational results in extreme diffraction-prone cases agree reasonably well with observations, analytical solutions and solutions of conventional refraction-diffraction models. It is shown that the agreement would improve further if singularities in the wave field (e.g., at the tips of breakwaters) could be properly accounted for. The implementation of this phase-decoupled refraction-diffraction approximation in SWAN shows that diffraction of random, short-crested waves, based on the mild-slope equation can be combined with the processes of refraction, shoaling, generation, dissipation and wave-wave interactions in spectral wave models. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The model employs a Taylor–Galerkin finite element technique for the discretization of the modeled area, which makes it flexible to represent bottom topography and irregular boundaries. The fractional step numerical scheme was adopted to split the wave action balance equation into three one-dimensional space equations, which can be solved efficiently by one-dimensional algorithms. The Flux-Corrected Transport method was also applied to circumvent the steep-gradients of the action density in the frequency space. The FEM code with unstructured grids improves the numerical schemes in the original SWAN to maintain computational efficiency at the operational stage. A simulation of wind wave activities for the monsoon and the 2000 Typhoon Bilis were performed using the FEM and SWAN models. The simulated results were compared with field observations in order to verify the suitability of the method.},

 abstract = {In this paper the fully nonlinear potential model based on a finite element method is used to investigate the nonlinear wave motion around a moving circular cylinder. The results for the cylinder in transient motion are compared with the experimental data and a much better agreement than the linear theory is found. Further simulation for a circular cylinder in sinusoidal motion is made. It is found that when the ratio of the cylinder diameter D to the wavelength L is relatively small at a fixed motion amplitude the nonlinear components of the runup on the cylinder surface at the second- and third-harmonic frequencies become more important and this is confirmed by the experimental data. Results for the hydrodynamic force are also provided for a cylinder oscillating in a channel. It is noticed that when the frequency of the cylinder motion in a channel is between the first and the second natural frequencies of the symmetric mode, the time history has components not only at the frequency of the cylinder motion but also at the first natural frequency. The latter remains significant over the period that the simulation is made. This has important implications to model testing. If measurement is to be made at such a frequency it may take long time for the motion to become periodic at the frequency of the cylinder motion. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

 abstract = {This paper investigates the application of inerter to a barge-type floating offshore wind turbine for the purpose of mitigating loads of the wind turbine structures induced by wind and wave. An inerter-based structural control system, consisting of a parallel connection of a spring, a damper, and an inerter-based network, is proposed. A nonlinear aeroelastic simulation tool for wind turbines called FAST-SC is employed for evaluating the performances of the inerter-based structural control system. Due to the inefficiency of implementing FAST-SC in optimizing the element parameters (spring stiffnesses, damping coefficients, inertances), a time-efficient parameter optimization method is proposed based on a simplified linear design model, where a mixed performance objective function including the tower-top fore-aft deflection and the TMD working space is minimized with respect to the element parameters. It is shown that there exists a tradeoff between the tower-top fore-aft deflection and the TMD working space. Moreover, numerical simulations based on the nonlinear FAST-SC code show that the overall performance can be improved by using an inerter, except the tower-top fore-aft load and the TMD working space. The inerter-based configurations tend to demand more TMD working space than the system with no inerter. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the overall performance can be improved while maintaining similar TMD working space as the system with no inerter.},

The wavemaker is doubly articulated and includes both piston and hinged wavemakers of variable draught. It is shown that the first-order evanescent eigenseries cannot be neglected when computing the amplitude of the second-order free wave. A previously neglected, time-independent solution that is required to satisfy an inhomogeneous kinematic boundary condition on the wavemaker as well as an inhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition on the free surface is examined in detail for the first time. This time-independent solution is found to accurately estimate the mean return flow in a closed wave flume computed by the Eulerian method. This mean return current due to Stokes drift is usually estimated using the principle of kinematic conservation of mass flux. Even though the first-order eigenseries will converge for any geometry of a generic planar wavemaker, the second-order solutions obtained from Stokes perturbation expansions will not converge for all planar wavemaker geometries. {\textcopyright} 1991, Cambridge University Press.

 abstract = {An investigation was conducted to examine the effects of key parameters such as intake temperature, equivalence ratio, engine load, intake pressure, spark timing and spring stiffness on the transition from SI combustion to HCCI combustion in a two-stroke free piston linear engine. Operation of the free piston engine was simulated based on the combination of three mathematical models including a dynamic model, a linear alternator model and a thermodynamic model. These mathematical models were combined and solved by a program written in Fortran. To validate the mathematical models, the simulation results were compared with experimental data in the SI mode. For the transition from SI combustion to HCCI combustion, the simulation results show that if the equivalence ratio is decreased, the intake temperature and engine load should be increased to get a successful SI-HCCI transition. However, the simulation results also show that the in-cylinder pressure is decreased, while the peak in-cylinder temperature in HCCI mode is increased significantly if the intake temperature is increased so much. Beside the successful SI-HCCI transition, the increase of intake pressure from Pin=1.1bar to Pin=1.6bar is one of solutions to reduce peak in-cylinder temperature in HCCI mode. However, the simulation results also indicate that if the intake pressure is increased so much (Pin=1.6bar), the engine knocking problem is occurred. Adjusting spring stiffness from k=2.9N/mm to k=14.7N/mm is also considered one of useful solutions for reducing the peak in-cylinder temperature in HCCI mode as well as avoiding engine knock. Besides, the change of spark timing is suggested as a benefic method to help the control of the SI-HCCI transition to be more convenient. To get a successful SI-HCCI transition with reducing of peak temperature in HCCI mode as well as avoiding engine knock, the simulation results show that the engine should be operated with following conditions: equivalence ratio ϕ=0.7, engine load RL=180$\Omega$, intake temperature Tin=400K, intake pressure Pin=1.2bar, spark timing in SI mode xig=3mm and spring stiffness k=14.7N/mm.},

This continues the work of Hunter (2012), which presented allowances based on global-average sea level and local storm tides. The inclusion of regional variations of sea-level rise (and its uncertainty) significantly increases the global spread of allowances. For the period 1990-2100 and the A1FI emission scenario (which the world is broadly following at present), these range from negative allowances caused by land uplift (in the northern regions of North America and Europe) to the upper 5-percentile which is greater than about 1 m (e.g. on the eastern coastline of North America). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The study regarding the boundary treatment has become an active research area in the mesh-free or particle method recently for measuring the accurate and robust pressure near the boundary. The penetrations of fluid particles may be happened if the adequate pressure boundary condition on the solid boundary cannot be satisfied. In this paper, a simple boundary treatment, which can be satisfied the non-homogenous Neumann boundary condition on the solid boundary and Dirichlet condition on the water surface, is proposed. The key point of our proposed treatment is that these boundary conditions are automatically satisfied by solving a modified pressure Poisson equation. Lastly, the effectiveness and accuracy of boundary treatment proposed are then authenticated with couples of numerical analysis and compared with the experimental tests.},

 abstract = {Wave power presents significant advantages with regard to other CO2-free energy sources, among which the predictability, high load factor and low visual and environmental impact stand out. Galicia, facing the Atlantic on the north-western corner of the Iberian Peninsula, is subjected to a very harsh wave climate; in this work its potential for energy production is assessed based on three-hourly data from a third generation ocean wave model (WAM) covering the period 1996–2005. Taking into account the results of this assessment along with other relevant considerations such as the location of ports, navigation routes, and fishing and aquaculture zones, an area is selected for wave energy exploitation. The transformation of the offshore wave field as it propagates into this area is computed by means of a nearshore wave model (SWAN) in order to select the optimum locations for a wave farm. Two zones emerge as those with the highest potential for wave energy exploitation. The large modifications in the available wave power resulting from relatively small changes of position are made apparent in the process.},

Second, the resource is characterised in terms of sea state parameters. The bulk of the annual wave energy is provided by waves with significant wave heights of 1.5e4.0 m, energy periods of 10.5e13.5 s, and mean deep-water direction NWeWNW. Finally, wave interaction with the irregular bathymetry gives rise, in certain nearshore areas, to significant concen-trations of wave energy.

Most of the energy is provided by IV quadrant waves with significant wave heights between 2 m and 5 m and energy periods between 11 s and 13 s. After analysing the offshore resource, numerical modelling is used to investigate the inshore wave patterns. A coastal wave model is validated with wave buoy data and applied to three case studies representative of storm, winter and summer conditions. Inshore wave energy concentration areas, of interest as prospective wave farm sites, are found to occur west of Cape Vidio and on the western side of the Cape Pe{\~{n}}as peninsula. The methodology used in this investigation may serve as a model for wave energy assessments in other regions, especially where both the offshore and inshore resources are of consequence.},

 abstract = {The area around Cape Estaca de Bares (the northernmost point of Iberia) presents a great potential for wave energy exploitation owing to its prominent position, with average deepwater wave power values exceeding 40kW/m. The newly available SIMAR-44 dataset, composed of hindcast data spanning 44 years (1958–2001), is used alongside wave buoy data and numerical modelling to assess this substantial energy resource in detail. Most of the energy is provided by waves from the IV quadrant, generated by the prevailing westerlies blowing over the long Atlantic fetch. Combined scatter and energy diagrams are used to characterise the wave energy available in an average year in terms of the sea states involved. The lion's share is shown to correspond to significant wave heights between 2 and 5m and energy periods between 11 and 14s. The nearshore energy patterns are then examined using a coastal wave model (SWAN) with reference to four situations: average wave energy, growing wave energy (at the approach of a storm), extreme wave energy (at the peak of the storm) and decaying wave energy (as the storm recedes). The irregular bathymetry is found to produce local concentrations of wave energy in the nearshore between Cape Prior and Cape Ortegal and in front of Cape Estaca de Bares, with similar patterns (but varying wave power) in the four cases. These nearshore areas of enhanced wave energy are of the highest interest as prospective sites for a wave energy operation. The largest of them is directly in the lee of a large underwater mount west of Cape Ortegal. In sum, the Estaca de Bares area emerges as one of the most promising for wave energy exploitation in Europe.},

 abstract = {The studies on floating offshore wind turbines have been increasing over recent decades due to the growing investments of industries in marine renewable energy. Compared with horizontal-axis wind turbines, research on vertical-axis wind turbines is relatively few, though the latter may have advantages over the former in some aspects, for example, potentially lower cost of energy. In this paper, the characteristics of the motion responses of a barge-type floating system with four moonpools and a vertical-axis wind turbine are experimentally and numerically investigated. The focus is on the gyroscopic effects of turbine rotations on the motion responses of the floating system under different wave conditions. Physical model tests are conducted in a wave tank, where a 2-MW-class turbine is modelled in the 1:100 scale. It is found that the first-order sway and roll motion amplitudes near the resonant frequencies are reduced by the turbine rotations, whereas the first-order heave motion of the floating system is hardly influenced. The second-order motion responses and mooring tether tensions may be significantly amplified with the increasing rotating speed of turbine. The maximum ratio of the second-order response amplitude of roll motion to the first-order roll amplitude is up to 17% in the experiments of this study. A radiation and diffraction code based on linear potential flow theory is used to predict the motion responses and mooring forces. The comparisons with experimental data suggest that the viscous damping of water resonance in moonpools and the gyroscopic effects of turbine rotations should be taken into account in predictions.},

 abstract = {Harmonic resonance of a short-crested water wave field, one of the three-dimensional water waves, is due to the multiple-like structure of the solutions. In a linear description, the harmonic resonance is due to the resonance between the fundamental of the wave and one of its harmonics propagating at the same phase speed for particular wave parameter regions depending on the depth of the fluid, the wave steepness, and the degree of three-dimensionality. Former studies showed that (i) an Mth-order harmonic resonance is associated with a superharmonic instability of class I involving a (2M + 2)-mode interaction and (ii) the instability corresponds to one sporadic “bubble” of instability. However, these first-step studies dealt with nonbifurcated solutions and thus incomplete solutions. In the present study, the complete set of short-crested wave solutions was computed numerically. It is found that the structure of the solutions is composed of three branches and a turning point that matches two of them. Then, the stability of the bifurcating solutions along their branches was computed. Of interest, another bubble of instability was discovered that is very close to the turning point of the solutions, and the instabilities are no longer sporadic. Harmonic resonances of short-crested water waves are thus associated with two bubbles of instability; the first one is located in a branch in which the turning point is present, and the second one is located in another branch that is continuous in the vicinity of the bifurcation point.

 abstract = {ABSTRACT:The nonlinear wave radiation of a surface-piercing body of arbitrary shape in three dimensions is investigated by a timedomain second-order method. In this approach, Taylor series expansions are applied to the body surface boundary condition and the free surface boundary conditions, and Stokes perturbation procedure is then used to establish corresponding boundary value problems at first and second order with time-independent boundaries. These are treated by a time-stepping procedure, in which the wave field at each time step is solved by a boundary integral equation method based on Green''s theorem. Numerical results including free surface profiles and hydrodynamic forces are presented for the case of a truncated surface-piercing circular cylinder undergoing specified sinusoidal surge and heave motions. Contributions to the hydrodynamic force from the various second-order force components are highlighted. It is found that steady state solutions are attained over a reasonably short duration of simulation time, and that the method is accurate, computationally efficient, and numerically very stable. INTRODUCTIONDemand from the offshore industry to refine existing design procedures has led to increased interest in hydrodynamic research on the development of nonlinear wave diffraction-radiation theory in order to predict the effects of extreme waves on offshore structures. In general, two categories of method are used to treat nonlinear wave interactions with large fixed or floating structures. Such methods enforce a weak far-field condition and are considered to be algebraically complicated. The other approach involves a numerical solution to the full nonlinear problem by using a time-stepping scheme, in which a suitable field equation is solved at each time step as the free surface moves to a new position (e.g., Vinje and Brevig, 1981; Isaacson, 1982; Grosenbaugh and Yeung, 1989). This method involves a number of numerical complications and demands considerable computing resources.},

For implementation of a low cost AHRS system Micro-electrical-Mechanical system (MEMS) based sensors are used such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. Accelerometers suffer from errors caused by external accelerations that sums to gravity and make accelerometers based rotation inaccurate. Gyroscopes can remove such errors but create drifting problems. So for getting the precise data additionally two very common and well known filters Complementary and Kalman are introduced to the system. In this paper a comparison of system performance using these two filters is shown separately so that one would be able to select filter with better performance for his/her system.},

 abstract = {We developed a special combination of vortex method and particle trajectory tracking method, which is applicable to internal unsteady two-phase flows. This method is a completely grid-free Lagrangian-Lagrangian simulation, which is able to simulate interactions between particles and the fluid flow. This method provides calculation of unsteady, high Reynolds number and vortical flows without use of any conventional time-averaged turbulence models. However, there is no application of this kind of method to internal multiphase flows, though many industrial multiphase flows are internal. In this study, internal liquid-solid two-phase flows had been analyzed by the new method, in which use of vortex introduction model enables us to simulate the dynamic behavior of separation or reattachment vortices without assuming locations of separation point. Calculation results, which were simplified as one-way model, showed good agreements with the experimental data. The results of the mixing process of solid particles showed that vortices dominate particle motions. The present method can be useful in the design of industrial multiphase flows, because it is able to simulate the unsteady interaction of particles with turbulent vortex structures.},

Increases in wind speed, wave height and storm surge due to intensification of tropical cyclones are discussed. Wind speed and wave height are proportional to the square root of pressure depression in a tropical cyclone, whereas storm surge increases linearly with pressure depression. Impacts of global warming, especially those of sea level rise, are investigated on wave run-up on coastal structures, wave overtopping and stability of armor blocks and breakwaters. Amplified impacts are found on coastal structures in shallow water. A response strategy is proposed for adaptation of coastal structures to global warming. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the condition number of ATA is square of that of A, and convergence becomes problematic for severely ill-conditioned problems even with preconditioning. In this paper, we propose two methods for applying the GMRES method to the least squares problem by using an n × m matrix B. We give the necessary and sufficient condition that B should satisfy in order that the proposed methods give a least squares solution. Then, for implementations for B, we propose an incomplete QR decomposition IMGS(l). Numerical experiments showed that the simplest case l = 0 gives the best results, and converges faster than previous methods for severely ill-conditioned problems. The preconditioner IMGS(0) is equivalent to the case B = (diag(A TA))-1AT, so (diag(ATA)) -1AT was the best preconditioner among IMGS(l) and Jennings' IMGS($\tau$). On the other hand, CG-IMGS(0) was the fastest for well-conditioned problems.},

The most energetic sites are on the western side of Sicily. In the three hotspots identified, the mean energy flux is within the range of 5.33-7.52 kW/m. The analysis shows that all considered devices have a low capacity factor in their original configurations (2.19%-5.12%). The main causes of the poor results in terms of energy production are related to the fact that such devices are optimized for high-energy waves. A resizing of the devices on the basis of the local wave climate showed that a capacity factor that exceeds 30% could be obtained. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The shallow water limit of the Zakharov Equation and consequences for (freak) wave prediction Abstract Finite amplitude deep-water waves are subject to nonlinear focussing, which when the phases are right, may give rise to giant waves or freak waves. The same process is responsible for the Benjamin-Feir instability. In shallow water, finite amplitude surface-gravity waves generate a current and deviations from the mean surface elevation. This stabilizes the Benjamin-Feir instability and the process of nonlinear focussing ceases to exist when kh < 1.363. This is a well-known property of surface gravity waves (Benjamin, 1967; Whitham, 1974) and, here it is shown for the first time, that the usual starting point for wave evolution studies, namely the Zakharov equation, shares this property as well.

Both kinematics and pressures were measured and compared with numerical simulations. Similar features were seen in both experiments and simulations. Maximum pressure is found when a vertical front is violently impacting on a vertical wall.

The mixed Eulerian–Lagrangian (MEL) technique and the fourth-order Runge–Kutta time stepping scheme is used to simulate the interaction between the floating barge and focused wave groups. As the peak spectra frequency is set as one-third of the natural frequency of the barge's roll motion, the influence of the peak wave amplitude of the incident focused wave groups on the roll response of the barge and wave loads is studied. The third-order components are found to be significant in both roll motion and moment as the incident peak wave amplitude increases. Relationship between the roll response of the barge and the peak spectrum frequency of the incident focused wave groups is also studied. The peak of the third-order roll response of the barge is found to decrease greatly as the triple peak spectral frequency deviates from the roll natural frequency.},

 abstract = {The finite cell method is a flexible discretization technique for numerical analysis on domains with complex geometries. By using a non-boundary conforming computational domain that can be easily meshed, automatized computations on a wide range of geometrical models can be performed. The application of the finite cell method, and other immersed methods, to large real-life and industrial problems is often limited due to the conditioning problems associated with these methods. These conditioning problems have caused researchers to resort to direct solution methods. This significantly limits the maximum size of solvable systems. Iterative solvers are better suited for large-scale computations than their direct counterparts due to their lower memory requirements and suitability for parallel computing. These benefits can, however, only be exploited when systems are properly conditioned. In this contribution we present an Additive-Schwarz type preconditioner that enables efficient and parallel scalable iterative solutions of large-scale multi-level hp-refined finite cell systems.},

 abstract = {Potential flows u = ▽∅ are solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations for viscous incompressible fluids for which the vorticity is identically zero. The viscous term $\mu$▽2 u = $\mu$▽▽2∅ vanishes, but the viscous contribution to the stress in an incompressible fluid (Stokes 1850) does not vanish in general. Here, we show how the viscosity of a viscous fluid in potential flow away from the boundary layers enters Prandtl's boundary layer equations. Potential flow equations for viscous compressible fluids are derived for sound waves which perturb the Navier-Stokes equations linearized on a state of rest. These linearized equations support a potential flow with the novel features that the Bernoulli equation and the potential as well as the stress depend on the viscosity. The effect of viscosity is to produce decay in time of spatially periodic waves or decay and growth in space of time-periodic waves. In all cases in which potential flows satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, which includes all potential flows of incompressible fluids as well as potential flows in the acoustic approximation derived here, it is neither necessary nor useful to put the viscosity to zero.},

 abstract = {Dissipation approximations have been used to calculate the drag on bubbles and drops and the decay rate of free gravity waves on water. In these approximations, viscous effects are calculated by evaluating the viscous stresses on irrotational flows. The pressure is not involved in the dissipation integral, but it enters into the power of traction integral, which equals the dissipation. A viscous correction of the irrotational pressure is needed to resolve the discrepancy between the zero-shear-stress boundary condition at a free surface and the non-zero irrotational shear stress. Here we show that the power of the pressure correction is equal to the power of the irrotational shear stress. The viscous pressure correction on the interface can be expressed by a harmonic series. The principal mode of this series is matched to the velocity potential and its coefficient is explicitly determined. The other modes do not enter into the expression for the drag on bubbles and drops. They vanish in the case of free gravity waves. {\textcopyright} 2004 Cambridge University Press.},

 abstract = {In this essay I will attempt to identify the main events in the history of thought about irrotational flow of viscous fluids. I am of the opinion that when considering irrotational solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations it is never necessary and typically not useful to put the viscosity to zero. This observation runs counter to the idea frequently expressed that potential flow is a topic which is useful only for inviscid fluids; many people think that the notion of a viscous potential flow is an oxymoron. Incorrect statements like "... irrotational flow implies inviscid flow but not the other way around" can be found in popular textbooks. Though convenient, phrases like "inviscid potential flow" or "viscous potential flow" confuse properties of the flow (potential or irrotational) with properties of the material (inviscid or viscous); it is better and more accurate to speak of the irrotational flow of an inviscid or viscous fluid. Every theorem about potential flow of perfect fluids with conservative body forces applies equally to viscous fluids in regions of irrotational flow. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {In this work, I present the form of the Navier-Stokes equations implied by the Helmholtz decomposition in which the relation of the irrotational and rotational velocity fields is made explicit. The idea of self-equilibration of irrotational viscous stresses is introduced. The decomposition is constructed by first selecting the irrotational flow compatible with the flow boundaries and other prescribed conditions. The rotational component of velocity is then the difference between the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations and the selected irrotational flow. To satisfy the boundary conditions, the irrotational field is required, and it depends on the viscosity. Five unknown fields are determined by the decomposed form of the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid: the rotational component of velocity, the pressure, and the harmonic potential. These five fields may be readily identified in analytic solutions available in the literature. It is clear from these exact solutions that potential flow of a viscous fluid is required to satisfy prescribed conditions, like the no-slip condition at the boundary of a solid or continuity conditions across a two-fluid boundary. It can be said that equations governing the Helmholtz decomposition describe the modification of irrotational flow due to vorticity, but the analysis shows the two fields are coupled and cannot be completely determined independently. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

To design and optimize a WEC, it is estimated that several million hours of operation must be simulated, perhaps one million hours of WEC simulation per year of the R&D program. This level of coverage is possible with linear potential flow (LPF) models, but the fidelity of the physics included is not adequate. Conversely, while Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) type computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers provide a high fidelity representation of the physics, the increased computational burden of these models renders the required amount of simulations infeasible. To scope the fast, high fidelity options, the present literature review aims to focus on what CFD theories exist intermediate to LPF and RANS as well as other modeling options that are computationally fast while retaining higher fidelity than LPF.},

 abstract = {The viscous effect on the roll motion of a rectangular structure was investigated in a two-dimensional wave tank. The structure was used to simulate a simplified barge in the beam sea condition. The structure with a draft one-half of its height was hinged at the center of gravity and free to roll (1 degree of freedom) by waves. The dynamic characteristics of the structure were first identified, including its roll natural period. The dynamic response of the barge-like structure under wave actions was then tested with regular waves with a range of wave periods that are shorter, equal to, and longer than its roll natural period. Particle image velocimetry was used to obtain the velocity field in the vicinity of the structure. The coupled interactions between the incident waves and the structure were demonstrated by examining the vortical flow fields to elucidate the effect of viscous damping (also called the eddy making damping) to the roll motion of the structure over wave periods. For incoming waves with a wave period same as the roll natural period, the structure roll motion was, as expected, greatly reduced by the viscous-damping effect. At wave periods shorter than the roll natural period, the structure roll motion was slightly reduced by the viscous effect. However, at wave periods longer than the roll natural period, the viscous effect due to flow separation at structure corners indeed amplified the roll motion. This indicates that not only can the viscous effect damp out the roll motion, it can also amplify the roll motion. {\textcopyright} 2006 ASCE.},

The accuracy of the method is verified through comparison with exact solutions to a two-dimensional Stefan problem. Convergence under grid refinement is demonstrated for dendritic solidification problems. Experimentally observed complex dendritic structures such as liquid trapping, tip-splitting, side branching, and coarsening are reproduced.

 abstract = {Plunging breakers are beyond the reach of all known analytical approximations. Previous numerical computations have succeeded only in integrating the equations of motion up to the instant when the surface becomes vertical. In this paper we present a new method for following the time-history of space-periodic irrotational surface waves. The only independent variables are the coordinates and velocity potential of marked particles at the free surface. At each time-step an integral equation is solved for the new normal component of velocity. The method is faster and more accurate than previous methods based on a two dimensional grid. It has also the advantage that the marked particles become concentrated near regions of sharp curvature. Viscosity and surface tension are both neglected. The method is tested on a free, steady wave of finite amplitude, and is found to give excellent agreement with independent calculations based on Stokes's series. It is then applied to unsteady waves, produced by initially applying an asymmetric distribution of pressure to a symmetric, progres­sive wave. The freely running wave then steepens and overturns. It is demonstrated that the surface remains rounded till well after the over­turning takes place.},

 abstract = {a b s t r a c t The main concern when utilizing renewable energy resources is their intermittency and variability. One way to deal with this shortcoming is to harvest energy from complementary sources. In this study, wind and wave energy were selected as such and further analyzed in terms of availability, variability, coher-ence, correlation and potential impact from extreme values. This resource characterization was per-formed in different timescales, during a 10-year period, using high resolution numerical modeling systems. Based on the results of this analysis, the most suitable areas for combined exploitation were identified and the possible merits from this synergy were pin-pointed and discussed. It was indicated that the most suitable areas for combined use are the western offshore areas of Europe. The wind and wave fields in these open sea areas reveal the lowest correlation in the examined field in contrast to those located in semi-enclosed and enclosed basins that exhibit the highest ones. The joint exploitation in the former regions gives a less variable power output with considerable fewer hours of zero pro-duction. Moreover, the suitable energy conversion system for a specific area is strongly dependent on the local characteristics of the available resource.},

The work aims to emphasize the effect of cylinder cross-section on the nature of impact as well as provide accurate and comprehensive data for the validation of computational fluid dynamics(CFD) codes. The experimental setup is based on a series of experiments conducted in the Research Institute for Applied Mechanics (RIAM) between the years 2010 and 2017. The gate motion is thoroughly studied and a novel gate motion formula is proposed based on the recent experimental data. The effect of gate obstruction on the time of impact with the cylindrical obstacle is presented and correlated to the parameters of the proposed motion profile thus emphasizing its significance in the numerical modeling of dam break flow. The effect of the cross-section of the cylinder is studied by examining the pressure signal on the cylinder as well as the vertical wall downstream of the cylinder. The pressure on the wall is compared with the no-obstacle case to highlight its effect on the pressure of the downstream conditions. The square cylinder is found to experience fairly similar pressure impulse as the circular cylinder. However, the square cylinder seems to impede the flow momentum in the x-direction more than the circular case.

At the same time, they also have more complex hydrodynamic characteristics due to their unique structures and motion forms.

We develop a general solution method for determining the amplification factor of different ocean topographies consisting of linearly varying and constant-depth segments to study how spectral distributions evolve over bathymetry, and apply our results to study the evolution of solitary waves. We find asymptotic results which suggest that solitary waves often interact with piecewise linear topographies in a counter-intuitive manner. We compare our analytical predictions with numerical results, with results from a new set of laboratory experiments from a physical model of Revere Beach, and also with the data on wave runup around an idealized conical island. We find good agreement between our theory and the laboratory results for the time histories of free-surface elevations and for the maximum runup heights. Our results suggest that, at least for simple piecewise linear topographies, analytical methods can be used to calculate effectively some important physical parameters in long-wave runup. Also, by underscoring the effects of the topographic slope at the shoreline, this analysis qualitatively suggests why sometimes predictions of field-applicable numerical models differ substantially from observations of tsunami runup.},

It is shown that hydrodynamic interactions are stronger when the bodies in an array system are in close proximity and these hydrodynamic interactions are reduced considerably and shifted to larger times before decaying to zero when the separation distances are increased. The numerical predictions of the radiation (added-mass and damping coefficients) and exciting (superposition of diffraction and Froude-Krylov) forces are presented on each floating body in an array system and on a single structure considering array as a single floating body. Furthermore, the numerical experiment shows the hydrodynamic interactions are more pronounced in the resonant frequency region that are of important for fluid forces over multibodies, responses, and designs of multibody floating systems.

The inner velocity potential consists of a particular solution, which is the same as that of HSSBT, and a homogeneous component, which is constructed by the superposition of the real-flow velocity potential and the reverse-flow reverse-time velocity potential. Since precise computations of HSSBT are prerequisite for the present theory, the calculation procedure adopted for HSSBT is described, converting the formulation into an equivalent initial-value problem in the time domain and applying the higher-order boundary-element method at each time step. Numerical results of added-mass and damping coefficients based on the present theory are shown for a modified Wigley model and compared with corresponding experiments and other computed results by the strip method, HSSBT, and 3-D Rankine-panel method.},

 abstract = {A non-linear calculation method based on the mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian (MEL) method is presented for wave-induced motions of a two-dimensional floating body. Attention is focused on an effective calculation of the hydrodynamic force associated with the temporal derivative of the velocity potential in the Bernoulli pressure equation. Unlike other existing methods, the acceleration field can be computed simultaneously with the velocity field, which contributes greatly to a reduction in the computation time. Computations are performed for a wall-sided model and a flared model, and numerical results of the waves at upwave and downwave positions and the body motions (sway, heave and roll) are compared with corresponding experiments. The overall agreement is very good, confirming the validity of the present method. The parametric oscillation in roll, observed for the flared model, is also discussed.},

 abstract = {Hydrodynamic interactions are studied between two floating bodies situated side by side and closely as a model of LNG-FPSO system. Main interest is placed on the wave drift forces and moments which are of second order in the wave amplitude and can be computed from quadratic products of the first-order quantities. To solve the first-order radiation and diffraction problems with hydrodynamic interactions taken into account, a higher-order boundary-element method is applied directly to the whole wetted surface of two ships. The second-order wave drift forces on each ship are computed by the near-field method based on the pressure integration, and validity is confirmed by comparing the sum of the forces on each ship with the corresponding value computed by the far-field method. Experiments are also conducted in beam waves for the side-by-side arrangement of a modified Wigley model and a rectangular barge model. Measured results are in favorable agreement with computed results not only for the first-order hydrodynamic forces but also for the second-order steady forces in sway and heave. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {In a previous work, Kataoka & Tsutahara (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 512, 2004a, p. 211) proved the existence of longitudinally stable but transversely unstable surface solitary waves by asymptotic analysis for disturbances of small transverse wavenumber. In the present paper, the same transverse instability is examined numerically for the whole range of solitary-wave amplitudes and transverse wavenumbers of disturbances. Numerical results show that eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of growing disturbance modes agree well with those obtained by the asymptotic analysis if the transverse wavenumber of the disturbance is small. As the transverse wavenumber increases, however, the growth rate of the disturbance, which is an increasing function for small wavenumbers, reaches a maximum and finally falls to zero at some finite wavenumber. Thus, there is a high-wavenumber cutoff to the transverse instability. For higher amplitude, solitary waves become longitudinally unstable, and the dependence of the eigenvalues on the transverse wavenumber exhibits various complicated patterns. We found that such eigenvalues versus transverse wavenumber can be simply grouped into three basic classes.},

 abstract = {A new experimental procedure to generate solitary waves in a flume using   a piston type wave maker, is derived from Rayleigh's (1876, [18])   solitary wave solution. Resulting solitary waves for dimensionless   amplitudes epsilon ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 are as pure as the ones   generated using Goring's (1978, [7]) procedure which is based on   Boussinesq (187 1a, [ 1]) solitary wade, with trailing waves of   amplitude lower than 3 % of the main pulse amplitude. In contrast with   Goring's procedure, the new procedure results in very little loss of   amplitude in the initial stage of the propagation of the solitary waves.   We show that solitary waves generated using this, new procedure are more   rapidly established. This is attributed to the better description of the   outskirts decay coefficient in a solitary wave given by Rayleigh's   solution rather than by a Boussinesq expression. Two other generation   procedures based on first-order (KdV) and second order shallow water   theories are also tested. Solitary waves generated by the latter are of   much lower quality than those generated with Rayleigh or   Boussinesq-based procedures.},

Some limitations of the E.T.D. for applications to geophysics appear in the discussion of strain energy. Finally the displacement field at the surface of a semi-infinite elastic medium which contains a particular B-nucleus at depth c is discussed. Although the considerations in this paper are in several respects incomplete and of a preliminary character it is expected that the reader may recognize the analogy of the E.T.D. with potential theory and will appreciate the power of the theory to unify several isolated problems on cracks and seismological models and to suggest further applications which are of geophysical interest.},

@article{Khambampati2016,
 abstract = {Flow of immiscible liquids through horizontal pipe is observed in many industrial process applications. The flow is mainly characterized by its flow regime, relative phase velocities, liquid fraction and water holdup. Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) that provides a cross-sectional image of flow distribution is helpful in monitoring the process. In this paper, the moving interfacial boundary between the immiscible liquids of stratified flow is estimated based on the measured voltages on the pipe surface. Determining the time-varying shape and location of the interfacial boundary has a practical significance. It gives us the cross-sectional liquid fraction which is a key parameter to analyze the hydrodynamic properties of flow. The interfacial boundary shape and location is parameterized with discrete front points and the forward solution is formulated using analytical boundary element method (BEM). The analytic formulation of BEM is simple with less number of unknowns therefore it is computationally efficient. Moreover, BEM discretizes the boundaries alone and is therefore appropriate choice for interfacial boundary estimation. To estimate the time-varying boundary, conventional methods that assume no change in flow distribution within the measurement time of full frame of voltage data are inadequate. Dynamic imaging methods that use one or few sets of data can improve the temporal resolution and hence they are more accurate and practical in realistic situations. Inverse problem is treated as a state estimation problem where the front points are considered as state variables and are estimated using extended Kalman filter. Numerical simulations and phantom experiments are performed to validate the performance of the proposed method.},

The presented hydroelastic FSI solver comprises of projection-based ISPH (Incompressible SPH) fluid model and SPH structure model, through consideration of continuity/Navier-Stokes equations for fluid phase as well as linear/angular momentum conservation equations for structure phase. The FSI solver includes a consistent fluid-structure coupling scheme along with a novel multi-resolution scheme incorporating a common influence length, a modified SPH density definition and a SPH-based formulated SPP (Space Potential Particle) scheme in order to achieve consistent particle-based discretizations, precise satisfaction of fluid-structure interface boundary conditions and accurate volume conservation at the interface. The present ISPH fluid model corresponds to a refined version of ISPH incorporating several previously developed refined schemes, and hence the proposed FSI solver is referred to as “Enhanced Multi-resolution ISPH-SPH”. Validations are performed qualitatively/quantitatively through reproductions of classical as well as ocean engineering benchmark tests. Comparisons are also made with an MPS-based FSI solver as well as an Explicit ISPH-based one. A preliminary extension of the proposed solver to three-dimensions is also presented.},

The inverse problem is to recover piecewise-constant source term, which means an identification function of an unknown subset D ⊂ $\Omega$. An additional information is taken as Neumann boundary condition, which leads us to consider the inverse problem under Cauchy boundary data. In this work a new computational algorithm for recovery the unknown source term is proposed. The main idea is that the identification function of subset D is replaced by a Heaviside function over the solution of an auxiliary elliptic equation. Then we formulate a minimization problem of a residual for overdetermination data, when a control is taken as the right-hand side of the auxiliary equation. Numerical implementation is based on the finite element method applying the open-source computing platform FEniCS and its package dolfin-adjoint. The capabilities of the given computational algorithm are shown by results of numerical solutions of 2D test problems.},

 abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 by ASME.This paper presents the results of quantifying uncertainty associated with the wave resource assessment in the North West Pacific. This study classifies uncertainty into 2 types: Aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. We defined the source of aleatory uncertainty as inter-annual variability of wave power and the source of epistemic uncertainty as difference between a model and an observation. Spectral analysis of inter-annual variability and correlation coefficient analysis between interannual variability and climate index such as Arctic Oscillation are conducted to quantify aleatory uncertainty. The results revealed that aleatory uncertainty in North West Pacific differs from that in North Atlantic. Regarding the cause of inter-annual variability, seas surrounding Japan can be classified into 4 regions: The sea of Okhotsk and Eastern Japan with high correlation with the North Pacific Index, the Japan Sea with Arctic Oscillation and Southern Japan with the typhoon frequency. These results provide the characteristic of uncertainty in wave power assessment in the North West Pacific, and they are helpful to establish standards of wave resource assessment in Japan.},

 abstract = {We study the diffraction, to second order, of plane monochromatic incident gravity waves by a vertically axisymmetric body. The second-order double-frequency diffraction potential is obtained explicitly. A sequence of one-dimensional integral equations along the generator of the body involving free-surface ring sources of general order are formulated and solved for the circumferential components of the second-order potential. The solution is expedited by analytic integration in the entire local-wave-free outer field of a requisite free-surface integral. The method is validated by extensive convergence tests and comparisons to semi-analytic results for the second-order forces and moments on a uniform vertical circular cylinder. Complete second-order forces, moments, surface pressures and run-up on the vertical cylinder as well as a truncated vertical cone are presented. A summary of the important findings is given in {\S}5.},

The fundamental stability analysis governing the propagation of transient wave disturbances on a panel mesh distributed on the free surface is carried out from first principles. The radiation condition is enforced by a dissipative beach selected to coincide with an outer annulus of panels. The fundamental physics governing the wave energy absorption is presented and the beach attributes are selected and validated for the linear and second-order problems. Computations are presented of the linear and sum-frequency second-order forces on a single and multiple truncated circular cylinders, and very good agreement is found with benchmark computations. The accuracy and efficiency of this method render it a promising candidate for the study of complex nonlinear wave induced phenomena upon offshore platforms, like springing and ringing. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

 abstract = {Many hope that ocean waves will be a source for clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy, yet wave energy conversion facilities may affect marine ecosystems through a variety of mechanisms, including competition with other human uses. We developed a decision-support tool to assist siting wave energy facilities, which allows the user to balance the need for profitability of the facilities with the need to minimize conflicts with other ocean uses. Our wave energy model quantifies harvestable wave energy and evaluates the net present value (NPV) of a wave energy facility based on a capital investment analysis. The model has a flexible framework and can be easily applied to wave energy projects at local, regional, and global scales. We applied the model and compatibility analysis on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada to provide information for ongoing marine spatial planning, including potential wave energy projects. In particular, we conducted a spatial overlap analysis with a variety of existing uses and ecological characteristics, and a quantitative compatibility analysis with commercial fisheries data. We found that wave power and harvestable wave energy gradually increase offshore as wave conditions intensify. However, areas with high economic potential for wave energy facilities were closer to cable landing points because of the cost of bringing energy ashore and thus in nearshore areas that support a number of different human uses. We show that the maximum combined economic benefit from wave energy and other uses is likely to be realized if wave energy facilities are sited in areas that maximize wave energy NPV and minimize conflict with existing ocean uses. Our tools will help decision-makers explore alternative locations for wave energy facilities by mapping expected wave energy NPV and helping to identify sites that provide maximal returns yet avoid spatial competition with existing ocean uses.},

 abstract = {As a weakly nonlinear model equations system for gravity-capillary waves on the surface of a potential fluid flow, a cubic-order truncation model is presented, which is derived from the ordinary Taylor series expansion for the free boundary conditions of the Euler equations with respect to the velocity potential and the surface elevation. We assert that this model is the optimal reduced simplified model for weakly nonlinear gravity-capillary solitary waves mainly because the generation mechanism of weakly nonlinear gravity-capillary solitary waves from this model is consistent with that of the full Euler equations, both quantitatively and qualitatively, up to the third order in amplitude. In order to justify our assertion, we show that this weakly nonlinear model in deep water allows gravity-capillary solitary wavepackets in the weakly nonlinear and narrow bandwidth regime where the classical nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger (NLS) equation governs; this NLS equation derived from the model is identical to the one directly derived from the Euler equations. We verify that both quantitative and qualitative properties of the gravity-capillary solitary waves of the model precisely agree with the counterparts of the Euler equations near the bifurcation point by performing a numerical continuation to find the steady profiles of weakly nonlinear gravity-capillary solitary waves of the primary stable bifurcation branch. In addition, unsteady numerical simulations, in which those solitary waves are used as initial conditions, are provided as supporting evidences. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Various artificial damping schemes for progressive water waves were evaluated in a three-dimensional numerical wave tank (3D NWT). Five types of damping schemes were applied to the end of a computational domain and their damping capabilities were compared to find an optimum artificial damping scheme. The 3D NWT was based on a nine-node, bi-quadratic, higher-order boundary element method (HOBEM). A semi-Lagrangian approach known as the Mixed-Eulerian-Lagrangian (MEL) method was used to capture the nonlinear free surface fluctuation. A Runge-Kutta fourth-order time integration scheme was used for time marching to produce a time history of water surface elevations. For efficient damping performance, four different ramping functions were introduced and applied to the damping coefficients, and their influences were evaluated in order to select an optimal ramping shape along the artificial damping zone. The conservation of total energy in the computational domain was ensured to verify wave dissipation in the artificial damping zone. The wave elevations at different locations in the damping zone were also compared in order to appraise the damping capabilities of the respective damping schemes. The optimal numerical damping scheme associated with a proper damping shape over a range of damping zones was proposed for an efficient numerical beach. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Experiments and several numerical studies were done on a power-take off system of a novel floating wave energy convertor. The wave energy convertor utilizes the changes in surface elevation of the waves to cause a column of water to rise and fall periodically in the caisson which creates a bi-directional flow. A cross flow turbine within the device uses this bi-directional flow to rotate in one direction. A 6 DOF ocean simulator was used to conduct experiments on the PTO system at a model to prototype scale of 1:3, for no-load conditions and loaded conditions. In the experiment, the parameters like pitching angles of the device, moment of inertia on the shaft, wave periods and rotational speeds of the turbine were varied. It was found that for all pitching angles, the device had optimum response at a wave period of 3 s. A moment of inertia of 0.053 kg m2 was found to be appropriate for all test cases. Peak hydraulic efficiencies between 35% and 45% were obtained for the range of 40–50 RPM for most test cases. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) tests then done to document and investigate the flow around the turbine and the inlet and exit nozzles. A commercial CFD software was used to carry out the numerical calculations and to observe the internal flow. Finally, a floating body simulation was conducted on to calculate the motion of the device at sea and thus calculate the overall performance of the device.},

Using the mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian (MEL) method for water particle movement, nonlinear waves were produced in the PNWT.

The diffraction and radiation problems were solved, and their solutions were confirmed by a comparison with previous studies.

 abstract = {Wind Farm Layout Optimization (WFLO) can be useful to minimize power losses associated with turbine wakes in wind farms. This work presents a new evolutionary WFLO methodology integrated with a recently developed and successfully validated Gaussian wake model (Bastankhah and Port{\'{e}}-Agel model). Two different parametrizations of the evolutionary methodology are implemented, depending on if a baseline layout is considered or not. The proposed scheme is applied to two real wind farms, Horns Rev I (Denmark) and Princess Amalia (the Netherlands), and two different turbine models, V80-2MW and NREL-5MW. For comparison purposes, these four study cases are also optimized under the traditionally used top-hat wake model (Jensen model). A systematic overestimation of the wake losses by the Jensen model is confirmed herein. This allows it to attain bigger power output increases with respect to the baseline layouts (between 0.72% and 1.91%) compared to the solutions attained through the more realistic Gaussian model (0.24–0.95%). The proposed methodology is shown to outperform other recently developed layout optimization methods. Moreover, the electricity cable length needed to interconnect the turbines decreases up to 28.6% compared to the baseline layouts.},

This review of original empirical work, the relationships theorized by each author, and their regions of applicability are detailed to give a historical perspective of wave breaking research but also to illustrate advances in recent years. Subsequently published validity investigations by other authors show the variability and limitations of each approximation and illustrate that the level of understanding in wave breaking parameters has progressed considerably. The understanding of the defining variables in wave breaking progresses annually, however predicting the location, depth and shape of the wave at breaking is still not universally defined. This is in part due to the inherent variability in nature of breaking waves; however, it is compounded by a lack of a collective measurement and definition system for wave breaking parameters. {\textcopyright} 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company and Japan Society of Civil Engineers.},

The tank structure is modelled by the finite element method and the fluid region by the indirect boundary element method. By minimizing a single Lagrange function defined for the entire system, the governing equation with symmetric coefficient matrices is obtained. To verify the newly developed method, the analysis results are compared with the shaking-table test data of a 3-D rectangular tank model and with the solutions by the direct BEM-FEM. Analytical studies are conducted on the dynamic behaviour of 3-D rectangular tanks using the method developed. In particular, the characteristics of the sloshing response, the effect of the rigidity of adjacent walls on the dynamic response of the tanks and the orthogonal effects are investigated. {\textcopyright} 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {Nonlinear interactions between large waves and freely floating bodies are investigated by a 2D fully nonlinear numerical wave tank (NWT). The fully nonlinear 2D NWT is developed based on the potential theory, MEL/material-node time-marching approach, and boundary element method (BEM). A robust and stable 4th-order Runge-Kutta fully updated time-integration scheme is used with regriding (every time step) and smoothing (every five steps). A special $\phi$n - $\eta$ type numerical beach on the free surface is developed to minimize wave reflection from end-wall and wave maker. The acceleration-potential formulation and direct mode-decomposition method are used for calculating the time derivative of velocity potential. The indirect mode-decomposition method is also independently developed for cross-checking. The present fully nonlinear simulations for a 2D freely floating barge are compared with the corresponding linear results, Nojiri and Murayama's (Trans. West-Jpn. Soc. Nav. Archit. 51 (1975)) experimental results, and Tanizawa and Minami's (Abstract for the 6th Symposium on Nonlinear and Free-surface Flow, 1998) fully nonlinear simulation results. It is shown that the fully nonlinear results converge to the corresponding linear results as incident wave heights decrease. A noticeable discrepancy between linear and fully nonlinear simulations is observed near the resonance area, where the second and third harmonic sway forces are even bigger than the first harmonic component causing highly nonlinear features in sway time series. The surprisingly large second harmonic heave forces in short waves are also successfully reproduced. The fully updated time-marching scheme is found to be much more robust than the frozen-coefficient method in fully nonlinear simulations with floating bodies. To compare the role of free-surface and body-surface nonlinearities, the body-nonlinear-only case with linearized free-surface condition was separately developed and simulated. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {The hydrodynamic interaction and mechanical coupling effects of two floating platforms connected by elastic lines are investigated by using a time-domain multi-hull/mooring/riser coupled dynamics analysis program. Particular attention is paid to the contribution of off-diagonal hydrodynamic interaction terms on the relative motions during side-by-side offloading operation. In this regard, the exact method (CMM: combined matrix method) including all the vessel and line dynamics, and the 12×12 hydrodynamic coefficients in a combined matrix is developed. The performance of two typical approximation methods (NHI/No Hydrodynamic Interaction: iteration method between two vessels without considering hydrodynamic interaction effects; SMM/Separated Matrix Method: iteration method between two vessels with partially considering hydrodynamic interaction effects, i.e. ignoring off-diagonal cross-coupling terms in the 12×12 hydrodynamic coefficient matrix) is also tested for the same side-by-side offloading operation in two different environmental conditions. The numerical examples show that there exists significant discrepancy at sway and roll modes between the exact and the approximation methods, which means that the cross-coupling (off-diagonal block) terms of the full hydrodynamic coefficient matrix play an important role in the case of side-by-side offloading operation. Therefore, such approximation methods should be used with care. The fender reaction forces, which exhibit large force with contact but no force without contact, are also numerically modeled in the present time-domain simulation study. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {A two-dimensional time domain, fully nonlinear numerical wave tank (NWT) based on potential theory, the mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, and the boundary element method was developed and applied to land-based oscillating water columns (OWCs) with compressed air inside the chamber. The nonlinear free-surface condition inside the chamber was specially devised to represent both the viscous effect of the water column motion and the pneumatic effect of the time-varying pressure. The latter not only influenced the water column motions, but also generated radiated waves to interfere with incident and reflected wave fields. Both linear and quadratic models are used for the viscous and pneumatic effects. The regular-wave cases are also compared with irregular-wave cases. The developed NWT was verified through comparison with viscous-flow-based numerical and experimental results for both narrow-gap and wide-gap chambers at two different skirt depths, with and without air ducts. All of the NWT simulations correlated well with experimental values for a variety of wave and chamber conditions, so that the developed numerical tool can be practically used for the optimal design of land-based OWCs. The fully nonlinear simulations were also compared with linear simulations. In case that had the same skirt depth and air duct area, the efficiency of the wide-gap chamber was generally higher than that of the narrow-gap chamber over a wider range of wavelengths, due to the larger amount of compressed air and the corresponding higher flow velocities.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates wave energy conversion in open water where the goal is to utilize the wave-field focusing effect of a stationary disc submerged a short depth beneath the water surface. Dynamic interaction of the disc with additional coupled, submerged inertias is used to minimize its oscillation. The method used to enable and extend this favorable dynamic coupling is discussed here. An oscillating water column in a submerged duct attached under a small circular opening in the disc and driven by the wave-field over the disc is used for wave energy conversion. Non-real-time reactive control of the water column response to enhance energy absorption is examined. Added mass, radiation damping, and exciting force values for the submerged disc are computed, and the focusing effect of a submerged stationary disc is confirmed with numerical calculations of surface elevation over the disc. Calculations of hydrodynamic performance suggest that energy absorption from the oscillating water column is significantly greater under control holding the disc stationary, and can be improved further by applying reactive loads tuned to the optimal susceptance and conductance associated with the oscillating water column. Although the control forces involved in holding the disc stationary may be large at lower wave numbers, the maximum deflection amplitudes of the compensation system are found to be within reasonable limits.},

Initially the liquid is at rest, and the contour touches its free surface at a single point. At the initial stage of the process the liquid motion is described within the framework of the acoustic approximation. It is known that, just behind the shock front which is generated under the impact, the liquid motion does not depend on the presence of the free surface for all time. The pressure distribution and the velocities of liquid particles inside this region are calculated analytically for an arbitrary contour. It is shown that liquid motion close to the contact points just before the shock wave escapes onto the free surface is self-similar; the singularity of the pressure is analysed. The focusing of the shock wave generated by the impact of a body with a shallow depression in the front surface is discussed.},

 abstract = {The present paper deals with the plane unsteady problem of the penetration of a blunt solid contour into an ideal compressible liquid. At the initial instant of time, the solid body touches the liquid free boundary at a single point. At the initial stage, the duration of which depends on the body geometry, the displacements of liquid particles are small and the disturbed fluid motion is described within the framework of the acoustic approximation. The main feature of the problem is the existence of a contact line between the free surface of the liquid and the solid-body surface. The position of this line is not known in advance and is to be determined together with the solution of the problem. A brief description of the method that provides a solution of complicated nonlinear problems such as this is given. The pressure distribution and the velocity field in the liquid are shown to be given in quadratures and in the case of a parabolic entering contour in an explicit form. For a parabolic entering contour the pressure at the top of the contour calculated using the model of an incompressible liquid is observed to deviate from a precise value by not more than 10% of the latter after the first expansion waves have passed the contact point.

Here, we present a numerical particle tracking methodology to predict the bias errors associated with particle image velocimetry (PIV) of flows with moving shocks. The methodology involves performing computational fluid dynamics simulations that yield time-varying flow fields, which are then used to compute the actual paths and velocities of the seeding particles. We test this approach on PIV measurements of the velocity field behind an expanding semi-cylindrical shock wave, generated by a pulsed sliding discharge. Although in transient high-speed compressible flows the PIV imaging accuracy is still hindered by the finite particle response, the proposed methodology allows for both a successful quantification of PIV errors as well as a direct comparison between particle-based velocimetry and numerical simulations.

To utilize the moderate water depth of 50–100 m ocean space around Japan, a barge-type FOWT was installed in Kitakyushu as part of a demonstration project conducted by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) of Japan. The FOWT mounts a 3 MW two-bladed wind turbine with blade diameter of 100 m and hub height of 72 m. The barge-type floating support structure is equipped with a moonpool in the center and a skirt at its bottom and is moored with 9 lines of catenary chains.

As the results, the simulation results showed a good agreement in general to the measurement data. However, some shifts in the peak frequency of the simulation's motion spectrum and a disagreement in waves with shorter wave periods were also observed. The possible causes of these differences are discussed thoroughly in this paper.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we present the novel concept of density maps for robust handling of static and rigid dynamic boundaries in fluid simulations based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). In contrast to the vast majority of existing approaches, we use an implicit discretization for a continuous extension of the density field throughout solid boundaries. Using the novel representation we enhance accuracy and efficiency of density and density gradient evaluations in boundary regions by computationally efficient lookups into our density maps. The map is generated in a preprocessing step and discretizes the density contribution in the boundary{\^{a}}€™s near-field. In consequence of the high regularity of the continuous boundary density field, we use cubic Lagrange polynomials on a narrow-band structure of a regular grid for discretization. This strategy not only removes the necessity to sample boundary surfaces with particles but also decouples the particle size from the number of sample points required to represent the boundary. Moreover, it solves the ever-present problem of particle deficiencies near the boundary. In several comparisons we show that the representation is more accurate than particle samplings, especially for smooth curved boundaries. We further demonstrate that our approach robustly handles scenarios with highly complex boundaries and even outperforms one of the most recent sampling based techniques.},

 abstract = {Highly accurate and precise heave decay tests on a sphere with a diameter of 300 mm were completed in a meticulously designed test setup in the wave basin in the Ocean and Coastal Engineering Laboratory at Aalborg University, Denmark. The tests were dedicated to providing a rigorous benchmark dataset for numerical model validation. The sphere was ballasted to half submergence, thereby floating with the waterline at the equator when at rest in calm water. Heave decay tests were conducted, wherein the sphere was held stationary and dropped from three drop heights: a small drop height, which can be considered a linear case, a moderately nonlinear case, and a highly nonlinear case with a drop height from a position where the whole sphere was initially above the water. The precision of the heave decay time series was calculated from random and systematic standard uncertainties. At a 95% confidence level, uncertainties were found to be very low—on average only about 0.3% of the respective drop heights. Physical parameters of the test setup and associated uncertainties were quantified. A test case was formulated that closely represents the physical tests, enabling the reader to do his/her own numerical tests. The paper includes a comparison of the physical test results to the results from several independent numerical models based on linear potential flow, fully nonlinear potential flow, and the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. A high correlation between physical and numerical test results is shown. The physical test results are very suitable for numerical model validation and are public as a benchmark dataset.},

 abstract = {<p>In the Lesser Antilles, coastal inundations from hurricane-induced storm surges cause great threats to lives, properties, and ecosystems. Assessing current and future storm surge hazard with sufficient spatial resolution is of primary interest to help coastal planners and decision makers develop mitigation and adaptation measures. Here, we use wave-current numerical models and statistical methods to investigate worst case scenarios and 100-year surge levels for the case study of Martinique, under present climate or considering a potential sea-level rise. Results confirm that the wave setup plays a major role in Lesser Antilles, where the narrow island shelf impedes the piling-up of large amounts of wind-driven water on the shoreline during extreme events. The radiation stress gradients thus contribute significantly to the total surge, up to 100&thinsp;% in some cases. The non-linear interactions of sea level rise with bathymetry and topography are generally found to be relatively small in Martinique, but can reach several tens of centimeters in low-lying areas where the inundation extent is strongly enhanced compared to present conditions. These findings further emphasize the importance of waves for developing operational storm surge warning systems in the Lesser Antilles, and encourage caution when using static methods to assess the impact of sea level rise on storm surge hazard.</p>},

 abstract = {In this paper, four incomplete boundary element formulations, including the real-part singular boundary element, the real-part hypersingular boundary element, the imaginary-part boundary element and the plane-wave element methods, are used to solve the free vibration problem. Among these incomplete boundary element formulations, the real-part singular and the hypersingular boundary elements are of the singular type and the other two are of the regular type. When the incomplete formulation is used, the spurious eigensolution may be encountered. An auxiliary system, whose boundary conditions are linearly independent of those of the original system, is required in the proposed method in order to eliminate the spurious eigensolution. A mathematical proof is given to show that the spurious eigensolution will appear in both the original and auxiliary systems. As a result, one can eliminate spurious eigensolution by means of the generalized singular-value decomposition method. In addition to the spurious eigensolution problem, the regular boundary element formulation further suffers ill-conditioned behaviors in the problem solver. It is explained analytically using a circular domain why ill-conditioned behaviors exist. Two main ill-conditioned problems are the numerical instability of solution and the nonexistence of solution. To solve the numerical instability of solution problem existing in these proposed regular formulations, the Tikhonov's regularization technique is used to improve the condition number of the leading coefficient matrix; further, the generalized singular-value decomposition method is used to eliminate spurious eigensolutions. Numerical examples are given to verify the performance of these proposed methods, and the results match the analytical values well.},

In this paper, general aspects of the modulational instability of standing waves are considered. This problem has difficulties that do not arise in the modulational instability of traveling waves. Here we propose a new geometric formulation for the linear stability problem, based on embedding the standing wave in a four-parameter family of nonlinear counterpropagating waves. Multisymplectic geometry is shown to encode the stability properties in an essential way. At the weakly nonlinear level we obtain the surprising result that standing waves are modulationally unstable only if the component traveling waves are modulation unstable. Systems...},

 abstract = {The free surface bow flow around a fast and fine ship in calm water is studied with an emphasis on generation and evolution of the breaking and splashing bow wave using the 2Dt theory. A temporal domain-decomposition strategy is adopted which combines sequentially two Lagrangian methods: a potential-flow solution, given by a boundary element method (BEM), follows the jet evolution up to the breaking and then initiates a rotational solution, provided by a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique. The latter describes the splashing and the evolution of rotational flow structures generated during the evolution. The compound method is very efficient and proved to be able to capture the breaking features. A validation has been performed through comparison with experimental data and other numerical solutions available in the literature. The DDG51 vessel is used to carry on a parameter investigation in terms of the ship speed (Froude number) and surface tension. The analysis confirms a substantial influence of the Froude number on the patterned morphology and highlights the importance of surface tension for small-scale ships (e.g. small-scale models tested in towing tanks) in inhibiting the jet formation and evolution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Detailed analyses of patterns of body and fin motion and the effects of these movements on water flow patterns have helped scientists understand the causes and effects of hydrodynamic patterns produced by swimming fish. Recent developments include the study of the center-of-mass motion of swimming fish and the use of volumetric imaging systems that allow three-dimensional instantaneous snapshots of wake flow patterns. The large numbers of swimming fish in the oceans and the vorticity present in fin and body wakes support the hypothesis that fish contribute significantly to the mixing of ocean waters. New developments in fish robotics have enhanced understanding of the physical principles underlying aquatic propulsion and allowed intriguing biological features, such as the structure of shark skin, to be studied in detail.},

Through his influence on science policy and his eloquent advocacy of applications, he has encouraged many young mathematicians in the United States to choose secular rather than monastic mathematics. Abstract. In this talk we discuss the almost periodic behavior in time of space periodic solutions of the KdV equation U + UU + Uxx O. We present a new proof, based on a recursion relation of Lenart, for the existence of an infinite sequence of conserved functionals F,,(u) of form P,.(u) dx, Pn a polynomial in u and its derivatives; the existence of such functionals is due to Kruskal, Zabusky, Miura and Gardner. We review and extend the following result of the speaker: the functions u minimizing Flv+l(u) subject to the constraints F(u) A i,/" 0, , N, form N-dimensional tori which are invariant under the KdV flow. The extension consists of showing that for certain ranges of the constraining parameters Aj the functional Ftv+t(u) has minimax stationary points; these too form invariant N-tori. The Hamiltonian structure of the KdV equation, discovered by Gardner and also by Faddeev and Zakharov, which is used in these studies, is described briefly. In an Appendix, M. Hyman describes numerical studies of the stability of some invariant 2-tori for the KdV flow; the numerical evidence points to stability.},

The further evolution (rebound) of the toroidal bubble is considered with the loss of system energy taken into account. The energy loss is incorporated into a mathematical model by a discontinuous jump in the potential energy at the minimum volume during the short collapse-rebound period accompanying wave emission. This implementation is first tested with the spherically oscillating bubble system using the theoretical Rayleigh - Plesset equation. Excellent agreement with experimental data for the bubble radius evolution up to three oscillation periods is obtained. Secondly, the incorporation of energy loss is tested with the motion of an oscillating bubble system in the neighbourhood of a rigid boundary, in an axisymmetric geometry, using a boundary integral method. Example calculations are presented to demonstrate the possibility of capturing the peculiar entity of a counterjet, which has been reported only in recent experimental studies. {\textcopyright} 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

 abstract = {In this study, a risk assessment system has been developed by performing the reliability analysis for wave run-up and armor stability of inclined coastal structures for various scenarios of long-term sea level rise due to climate change. The change of probability of failure for armor stability and wave runup due to sea level rise has been calculated against various design parameters such as size of armor units, structure slope, and freeboard of the structure. It is found that the effect of sea level rise is negligible outside the surf zone. Inside the surf zone, however, the effect increases with decreasing water depth so that more increase of probability of failure is calculated in smaller water depth for the same sea level rise. By comparing the results before and after the sea level rise, it is possible to evaluate how the sea level rise influences wave run-up and armor stability of the structure. The results of the present study could be used for maintenance or reinforcement planning of existing structures as well as in the design of new structures to cope with future sea level rise. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {— It has been reported worldwide that muddy seafloors can extract a significant fraction of the energy stored in overpassing ocean waves within several wavelengths. We consider a synthetic-seabed-carpet, supported by multiple springs and generators, that should extract wave energy the same way as muddy seafloor does. This paper presents the analytical model, the construction of the first working prototype and the experimental results of this novel concept called the Carpet of Wave Energy Conversion (CWEC). We successfully demonstrated its capability to absorb and convert wave energy for multiple sea states. As the CWEC operates completely submerged, it imposes no threat for overpassing ships and has no effect on oceanfront scenes. The CWEC's orientation combines the advantages of a point absorber, an attenuator and a terminator: it is wave-direction-independent, has a high absorption efficiency and can be exposed to high wave energy flux with its flexible spread perpendicular to the wave-propagation direction. The ability to cancel waves can be used to create safe zones in the ocean, prevent erosion and protect harbors. Secondly, the CWEC's primary energy conversion creates seawater at high pressure. This can be used to generate electricity, be used for desalination and for the distribution of fresh water. High pressure water can supply pumped-storage hydroelectric power plants, which are the most efficient way to balance the electrical grid.},

 abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

 abstract = {The substantial wave energy resource of the US Pacific Northwest (i.e. off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and N. California) is assessed and characterized. Archived spectral records from ten wave measurement buoys operated and maintained by the National Data Buoy Center and the Coastal Data Information Program form the basis of this investigation. Because an ocean wave energy converter must reliably convert the energetic resource and survive operational risks, a comprehensive characterization of the expected range of sea states is essential. Six quantities were calculated to characterize each hourly sea state: omnidirectional wave power, significant wave height, energy period, spectral width, direction of the maximum directionally resolved wave power and directionality coefficient. The temporal variability of these characteristic quantities is depicted at different scales and is seen to be considerable. The mean wave power during the winter months was found to be up to 7 times that of the summer mean. Winter energy flux also tends to have a longer energy period, a narrower spectral width, and a reduced directional spread, when compared to summer months. Locations closer to shore, where the mean water depth is less than 50 m, tended to exhibit lower omnidirectional wave power, but were more uniform directionally. Cumulative distributions of both occurrence and contribution to total energy are presented, over each of the six quantities characterizing the resource. It is clear that the sea states occurring most often are not necessarily those that contribute most to the total incident wave energy. The sea states with the greatest contribution to energy have significant wave heights between 2 and 5 m and energy periods between 8 and 12 s. Sea states with the greatest significant wave heights (e.g.>7 m) contribute little to the annual energy, but are critically important when considering reliability and survivability of ocean wave energy converters.},

 abstract = {The level-set method is a popular method for interface capturing. One of the advantages of the level-set method is that the curvature and the normal vector of the interface can be readily calculated from the level-set function. However, in cases where the level-set method is used to capture topological changes, the standard discretization techniques for the curvature and the normal vector do not work properly. This is because they are affected by the discontinuities of the signed-distance function half-way between two interfaces. This article addresses the calculation of normal vectors and curvatures with the level-set method for such cases. It presents a discretization scheme that is relatively easy to implement in to an existing code. The improved discretization scheme is compared with a standard discretization scheme, first for a case with no flow, then for a case where two drops collide in a shear flow. The results show that the improved discretization yields more robust calculations in areas where topological changes are imminent.},

 abstract = {Ship hull structural damages are often caused by extreme wave-induced loads. Reliable load predictions are required to minimize the risk of structural failures. One conceivable approach relies on direct computations of extreme events with appropriate numerical methods. In this perspective, we present a systematic study comparing results obtained with different computational methods for wave-induced loads and motions of different ship types in regular and random irregular long-crested extremes waves. Significant wave heights between 10.5 and 12.5 m were analyzed. The numerical methods differ in complexity and are based on strip theory, boundary element methods (BEM) and unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) equations. In advance to the comparative study, the codes applied have been enhanced by different researchers to account for relevant nonlinearities related to wave excitations and corresponding ship responses in extreme waves. The sea states investigated were identified based on the Coefficient of Contribution (CoC) method. Computed time histories, response amplitude operators and short-term statistics of ship responses and wave elevation were systematically compared against experimental data. While the results of the numerical methods, based on potential theory, in small and moderate waves agreed favorably with the experiments, they deviated considerably from the measurements in higher waves. The URANS-based predictions compared fairly well to experimental measurements with the drawback of significantly higher computation times.},

A numerical model using this bore structure to treat the process of wave breaking and subsequent shoreward propagation was developed. The nonlinear shallow water equations (NLSW) were solved using the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) shock capturing scheme employed in gas dynamics. Wave breaking and post-breaking propagation are handled automatically by this scheme and ad hoc terms are not required. A computational domain mapping technique was used to model the shoreline movement. This numerical scheme was found to provide a relatively simple and reasonably good prediction of various aspects of the run-up process. The energy dissipation associated with wave breaking of solitary wave run-up (excluding the effects of bottom friction) was also estimated using the results from the numerical model.},

 abstract = {During the past few decades, wave energy has received significant attention for harnessing ocean energy. Industry has proposed many technologies and, based on their working principle, these technologies generally can be categorized into oscillating water columns, point absorbers, overtopping systems, and bottom-hinged systems. In particular, many researchers have focused on modeling the point absorber, which is thought to be the most cost-efficient technology to extract wave energy. To model such devices, several modeling methods have been used such as analytical methods, boundary integral equation methods and Navier–Stokes equation methods. The first two are generally combined with the use of empirical solution to represent the viscous damping effect, while the last one is directly included in the solution. To assist the development of wave energy conversion (WEC) technologies, this paper extensively reviews the methods for modeling point absorbers.},

 abstract = {A Lagrangian radial basis function-based particle hydrodynamics method (RBFPH) is proposed. In RBFPH method, the differential quadrature technique is combined with radial basis function (RBF) to obtain the meshless high-dimensional derivative approximations for randomly distributed particles; a particular solution of RBF is chosen to ensure the positive definite of the interpolating matrix. Like the conventional RBF, RBFPH has the advantages of simple form, isotropy and high accuracy, and is suitable for numerical calculation. Moreover, all particles in RBFPH can move with the fluid, so RBFPH may conveniently compute complex flows with the moving boundary. A series of numerical examples are conducted to test the accuracy of RBFPH, and the results show the RBFPH has second-order convergence, which shows its great advantage in terms of accuracy. The RBFPH is validated by its application to the simulations of Taylor–Green flow, lid driven shear cavity flows, stretching of a free-surface circular fluid patch and flows around a cylinder. Excellent agreements with analytical solutions and reference results indicate that the proposed method has a promising application in simulating viscous flows with the moving boundary, large deformation, and free surface.},

@article{Lighthill1970,
 abstract = {This paper attempts to emulate the great study by Goldstein (1929) ‘On the vortex wake of a screw propeller', by looking for a dynamical theory of how another type of propulsion system has evolved towards ever higher performance. An ‘undulatory' mode of animal propulsion in water is rather common among invertebrates, and this paper offers a preliminary quantitative analysis of how a series of modifications of that basic undulatory mode, found in the vertebrates (and especially in the fishes), tends to improve speed and hydromechanical efficiency. Posterior lateral compression is the most important of these. It is studied first in ‘pure anguilliform' (eel-like) motion of fishes whose posterior cross-sections are laterally compressed, although maintaining their depth (while the body tapers) by means of long continuous dorsal and ventral fins all the way to a vertical ‘trailing edge'. Lateral motion of such a cross-section produces a large and immediate exchange of momentum with a considerable ‘virtual mass' of water near it. In {\c{c}} 2, ‘elongated-body theory' (an extended version of inviscid slender-body theory) is developed in detail for pure anguilliform motion and subjected to several careful checks and critical studies. Provided that longitudinal variation of cross-sectional properties is slow on a scale of the cross-sectional depth s (say, if the wavelength of significant harmonic components of that variation exceeds 5s), the basic approach is applicable and lateral water momentum per unit length is closely proportional to the square of the local cross-section depth. The vertical trailing edge can be thought of as acting with a lateral force on the wake through lateral water momentum shed as the fish moves on. The fish's mean rate of working is the mean product of this lateral force with the lateral component of trailing-edge movement, and is enhanced by the virtual-mass effect, which makes for good correlation between lateral movement and local water momentum. The mean rate of shedding of energy of lateral water motions into the vortex wake represents the wasted element in this mean rate of working, and it is from the difference of these two rates that thrust and efficiency can best be calculated. Section 3, still from the standpoint of inviscid theory, studies the effect of any development of discrete dorsal and ventral fins, through calculations on vortex sheets shed by fins. A multiplicity of discrete dorsal (or ventral) fins might be thought to destroy the slow variation of cross-sectional properties on which elongated-body theory depends, but the vortex sheets filling the gaps between them are shown to maintain continuity rather effectively, avoiding thrust reduction and permitting a slight decrease in drag. Further advantage may accrue from a modification of such a system in which (while essentially anguilliform movement is retained) the anterior dorsal and ventral fins become the only prominent ones. Vortex sheets in the gaps between them and the caudal fin may largely be reabsorbed into the caudal-fin boundary layer, without any significant increase in wasted wake energy. The mean rate of working can be improved, however, because the trailing edges of the dorsal and ventral fins do work that is not cancelled at the caudal fin's leading edge, as phase shifts destroy the correlation of that edge's lateral movement with the vortex-sheet momentum reabsorbed there. Tentative improvements to elongated-body theory through taking into account lateral forces of viscous origin are made in {\c{c}}4. These add to both the momentumandenergyof the water's lateral motions, but mayreduce the efficiencyof anguilliform motion because the extra momentum at the trailing edge, resulting from forces exerted by anterior sections, is badly correlated with that edge's lateral movements. Adoption of the ‘carangiform' mode, in which the amplitude of the basic undulation grows steeply from almost zero over the first half or even two-thirds of a fish's length to a large value at the caudal fin, avoids this difficulty. Any movement which a fish attempts to make, however, is liable to be accompanied by ‘recoil', that is, by extra movements of pure translation and rotation required for overall conservation of momentum and angular momentum. These recoil movements, a potentially serious source of thrust and efficiency loss in carangiform motion, are calculated in {\c{c}} 4, which shows how they are minimized with the right distribution of total inertia (the sum of fish mass and the water's virtual mass). It seems to be no coincidence that carangiform motion goes always with a long anterior region of high depth (possessing a substantial moment of total inertia) and a region of greatly reduced depth just before the caudal fin. The theory suggests ({\c{c}}5) that reduction of caudal-fin area in relation to depth by development of a caudal fin into a herring-like ‘pair of highly sweptback wings' should reduce drag without significant loss of thrust. The same effect can be expected (although elongated-body theory ceases to be applicable) from widening of the wing pair (sweepback reduction). That line of development of the carangiform mode in many of the Percomorphi leads towards the lunate tail, a culminating point in the enhancement of speed and propulsive efficiency which has been reached also along some quite different lines of evolution. A beginning in the analysis of its advantages is made here using a ‘twodimensional' linearized theory. Movements of any horizontal section of caudal fin, with yaw angle fluctuating in phase with its velocity of lateral translation, are studied for different positions of the yawing axis. The wasted energy in the wake has a sharp minimum when that axis is at the ‘three-quarter-chord point', but rate of working increases somewhat for axis positions distal to that. Something like an optimum regarding efficiency, thrust and the proportion of thrust derived from suction at the section's rounded leading edge is found when the yawing axis is along the trailing edge. This leads on the present over-simplified theory to the suggestion that a hydromechanically advantageous configuration has the leading edge bowed forward but the trailing edge straight. Finally, there is a brief discussion of possible future work, taking three-dimensional and non-linear effects into account, that might throw light on the commonness of a trailing edge that is itself slightly bowed forward among the fastest marine animals. {\textcopyright} 1970, Cambridge University Press.

 abstract = {Three recently measured wind and wave data sets in the northern part of Chesapeake Bay (CB) are presented. Two of the three data sets were collected in late 1995. The third one was collected in July of 1998. The analyzed wind and wave data show that waves were dominated by locally generated, fetch limited young wind seas. Significant wave heights were highly correlated to the local driving wind speeds and the response time of the waves to the winds was about 1 h. We also tested two very different numerical wave models, Simulation of WAves Nearshore (SWAN) and Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL), to hind-cast the wave conditions against the data sets. Time series model–data comparisons made using SWAN and GLERL showed that both models behaved well in response to a suddenly changing wind. In general, both SWAN and GLERL over-predicted significant wave height; SWAN over-predicted more than GLERL did. SWAN had a larger scatter index and a smaller correlation coefficient for wave height than GLERL had. In addition, both models slightly under-predicted the peak period with a fairly large scatter and low correlation coefficient. SWAN predicted mean wave direction better than GLERL did. Directional wave spectral comparisons between SWAN predictions and the data support these statistical comparisons. The GLERL model was much more computationally efficient for wind wave forecasts in CB. SWAN and GLERL predicted different wave height field distributions for the same winds in deeper water areas of the Bay where data were not available, however. These differences are as yet unresolved.},

The proposed model is firstly validated for the case of interaction of wave and a four-cylinder structure, with a good agreement with available experimental measurements. The validated model is then applied to investigate the seabed response around a four-cylinder structure at 0° and 45° incident angles. The comparison of liquefaction potential around individual cylinders in an array shows that downstream cylinder is well protected from liquefaction by upstream cylinders. For a range of incident wave parameters, the comparison with the results for a single pile shows the amplification of pressure within the seabed induced by progressive wave. This phenomenon is similar to the near-trapping phenomenon of free surface elevation within a cylinder array.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a review of the progress of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) towards high-order converged simulations. As a mesh-free Lagrangian method suitable for complex flows with interfaces and multiple phases, SPH has developed considerably in the past decade. While original applications were in astrophysics, early engineering applications showed the versatility and robustness of the method without emphasis on accuracy and convergence. The early method was of weakly compressible form resulting in noisy pressures due to spurious pressure waves. This was effectively removed in the incompressible (divergence-free) form which followed; since then the weakly compressible form has been advanced, reducing pressure noise. Now numerical convergence studies are standard. While the method is computationally demanding on conventional processors, it is well suited to parallel processing on massively parallel computing and graphics processing units. Applications are diverse and encompass wave-structure interaction, geophysical flows due to landslides, nuclear sludge flows, welding, gearbox flows and many others. In the state of the art, convergence is typically between the first- and second-order theoretical limits. Recent advances are improving convergence to fourth order (and higher) and these will also be outlined. This can be necessary to resolve multi-scale aspects of turbulent flow.},

The method, which is essentially equivalent to Ewald summation, is applied to two types of problem. First, it is applied to potential flow between parallel planes and in a rectangular channel, and, second, to two- and three-dimensional water-wave problems in which the depth is constant. In all cases the results of computations are presented showing the accuracy and efficiency of the resulting formulae.},

Comput. Mech. 22(5):404-412]. The advanced BEM with thin-body capabilities for two-dimensional linear elasticity is extended to general multi-domain problems and validated by the analytical solution of a special multi-coating problem. Detailed interfacial stress analysis for a two-layer coating system under uniform load distribution is investigated, through which the influence of coating thickness and material of the multi-coating system can be studied. The developed multi-coating analysis capability using the BEM provides not only a robust numerical tool for interfacial stress analysis of multi-coating systems with arbitrary coating thickness and number of coatings, but also the basis for future work concerning interface cracks, thermal effects and contact mechanics.},

(2001) for the simulation of fully nonlinear three-dimensional wave–wave and wave–body interactions, is here extended and applied to the study of two nonlinear three-dimensional wave–body problems: (a) the development of bow waves on an advancing ship; and (b) the steep wave diffraction and nonlinear high-harmonic loads on a surface-piercing vertical cylinder. For (a), we obtain convergent steady-state bow wave profiles for a flared wedge, and the Wigley and Series 60 hulls. We compare our predictions with experimental measurements and find good agreement. It is shown that upstream influence, typically not accounted for in quasi-two-dimensional theory, plays an important role in bow wave prediction even for fine bows. For (b), the primary interest is in the higher-harmonic ‘ringing' excitations observed and quantified in experiments. From simulations, we obtain fully nonlinear steady-state force histories on the cylinder in incident Stokes waves. Fourier analysis of such histories provides accurate predictions of harmonic loads for which excellent comparisons to experiments are obtained even at third order. This confirms that ‘ringing' excitations are directly a result of nonlinear wave diffraction.},

 abstract = {The fast multipole method (FMM) has been regarded as one of the top 10 algorithms in scientific computing that were developed in the 20th century. Combined with the FMM, the boundary element method (BEM) can now solve large-scale problems with several million degrees of freedom on a desktop computer within hours. This opened up a wide range of applications for the BEM that has been hindered for many years by the lack of efficiencies in the solution process, although it has been regarded as superb in the modeling stage. However, understanding the fast multipole BEM is even more difficult as compared with the conventional BEM, because of the added complexities and different approaches in both FMM formulations and implementations. This paper is an introduction to the fast multipole BEM for potential problems, which is aimed to overcome this hurdle for people who are familiar with the conventional BEM and want to learn and adopt the fast multipole approach. The basic concept and main procedures in the FMM for solving boundary integral equations are described in detail using the 2D potential problem as an example. The structure of a fast multipole BEM program is presented and the source code is also made available that can help the development of fast multipole BEM codes for solving other problems. Numerical examples are presented to further demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and potentials of the fast multipole BEM for solving large-scale problems. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Several co-propagating short-crested wave trains are generated in a basin at the State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering (SKLOE) in Shanghai, and the wavefields are measured and analysed both along and normal to the direction of propagation. These steady-state resonant waves are first calculated theoretically under the exact resonance criterion with sufficiently high nonlinearity, and then are generated in the basin by means of the main wave components that contain at least 95% of the wave energy. The steady-state wave spectra are quantitatively observed within the inherent system error of the basin and identified by means of a contrasting experiment. Both symmetrical and anti-symmetrical steady-state resonant waves are observed and the experimental and theoretical results show excellent agreement. These results offer the first experimental evidence of the existence of steady-state resonant waves with multiple solutions.},

As the kernel of this method, Wehausen's free-surface Green function is calculated by a newly-developed Gauss–Kronrod adaptive quadrature algorithm after elimination of its Cauchy-type singularities. To improve its computation efficiency, an analytical solution is derived for a fast evaluation of the Green function that needs to be implemented thousands of times. In addition, the OpenMP parallelization technique is applied to the formation of the influence coefficient matrix, significantly reducing the running CPU time. Computations are performed on wave-exciting forces and hydrodynamic coefficients for the long cylindrical structures, either floating or submerged.

Meanwhile, the influence of the solid wall on the pressure of SPH particles was considered.

Experimental observations regarding liquid height and wave front speed have found to be in agreement with existing literature. This agreement enables the authors, assuming a similar framework, to discuss the measured pressure loads as a consequence of the dam break wave front impacting on the downstream wall. These loads show a substantial variability which has been statistically characterized. The measured quantities have been compared with the scarce available data in the literature, whose consistency is discussed. Measurements have been conducted with two filling heights. Scaling effects for such heights are also analyzed.

The proposed method, which has already been successfully applied to scalar problems governed by the Poisson equation, does not require standard domain integration procedures, which employ cell discretisation, and is more robust than the dual-reciprocity technique. Although similar to the latter in some aspects, because it uses radial basis functions and their primitives for interpolation, the proposed methodology is more general. It allows the immediate use of interpolation functions of any type, and there are no convergence or monotonicity problems as the number of basis points is increased.},

 abstract = {A three-dimensional computer simulation of a concentrated emulsion in shear flow has been developed for low-Reynolds-number finite-capillary-number conditions. Numerical results have been obtained using an efficient boundary integral formulation with periodic boundary conditions and up to twelve drops in each periodically replicated unit cell. Calculations have been performed over a range of capillary numbers where drop deformation is significant up to the value where drop breakup is imminent. Results have been obtained for dispersed-phase volume fractions up to 30% and dispersed- to continuous-phase viscosity ratios in the range of 0 to 5. The results reveal a complex rheology with pronounced shear thinning and large normal stresses that is associated with an anisotropic microstructure that results from the alignment of deformed drops in the flow direction. The viscosity of an emulsion is only a moderately increasing function of the dispersed-phase volume fraction, in contrast to suspensions of rigid particles or undeformed drops. Unlike rigid particles, deformable drops do not form large clusters.},

The range of applicability is enlarged by the ability to produce volumetric grids around thin surfaces (such as shells, membranes, fabrics or surfaces with cusps), the generation of high aspect ratio grids for Navier-Stokes applications, the generation of higher order triangular and tetrahedral elements, and the generation of quadrilateral and hexahedral elements. Speed improvements are the result of reduced search overheads, as well as vectorization and parallelization. User friendliness is enhanced by the ability to grid directly discrete data and simpler ways of specifying the desired element size and shape in space.

 abstract = {The statistical density function is derived for a variable (such as the surface elevation in a random sea) that is weakly non-linear . In the first approximation the distribution is Gaussian, as is well known. In higher approximations it is shown that the distribution is given by successive sums of a Gram-Charlier series; not quite in the form that has sometimes been used as an empirical fit for observed distributions, but in a modified form due to Edgeworth. It is shown that the cumulants of the distribution are much simpler to calculate than the corresponding moments; and the approximate distributions are in fact derived by inversion of the cumulant-generating function. The theory is applied to random surface waves on water. The third cumulant and hence the skewness of the distribution of surface elevation is evaluated explicitly in terms of the directional energy spectrum. It is shown that the skewness A3 is generally positive, and positive upper and lower bounds for A, are derived. The theoretical results are compared with some measurements made by Kinsman (1960). It is found that for free, undamped surface waves the skewness of the dis- tribution of surface slopes is of a higher order than the skewness of the surface elevation. Hence the observed skewness of the slopes may be a sensitive indicator of energy transfer and dissipation within the water.},

 abstract = {A theory is given for the non-linear transfer of energy from gravity waves on water to capillary waves. When a progressive gravity wave approaches its maximum steepness it develops a sharp crest, at which the surface tension must be locally important. This gives rise to a travelling disturbance which produces a train of capillary waves ahead of the crest, i.e. on the foward face of the gravity wave. The capillary waves, once formed, then take further energy from the gravity wave through the radiation stresses, at the same time losing energy by viscosity. The steepness of the capillary waves is calculated and found to be in substantial agreement with some observations by C. S. Cox. An approximate expression for the ripple steepness near the crest of the gravity wave is (2 pi3)e -g6T prime k 2, where T is the surface tension constant and K Is the curvature at the wave crest. The ripple steepness also varies with distance from the wave crest. Under favourable circumstances the dissipation of energy by the capillary waves can be many times the dissipation in the gravity waves. The capillary waves may therefore play a significant role in the generation of waves by wind, in that they tend to delay the onset of breaking.},

 abstract = {In this paper we embark on a calculation of all the normal-mode perturbations of nonlinear, irrotational gravity waves as a function of the wave steepness. The method is to use as coordinates the stream-function and velocity potential in the steady, unperturbed wave (seen in a reference frame moving with the phase speed) together with the time t. The dependent quantities are the cartesian displacements and the perturbed stream function at the free surface. To begin we investigate the ‘superharmonics', i.e. those perturbations having the same horizontal scale as the fundamental wave, or less. When the steepness of the fundamental is small, the normal modes take the form of travelling waves superposed on the basic nonlinear wave. As the steepness increases the frequency of each perturbation tends generally to be diminished. At a steepness ak ≈ 0.436 it appears that the two lowest modes coalesce and an instability arises. There is evidence that this critical steepness corresponds precisely with the steepness at which the phase velocity is a maximum, considered as a function of ak. The calculations are facilitated by the discovery of some new identities between the coefficients in Stokes's expansion for waves of finite amplitude.},

Reasons why the ratio ā/(2m0)1/2 should differ from unity are discussed. It is shown that the effect of finite wave steepness would be to increase the ratio by a factor [1 + \n(ak)2] approximately, contrary to observation. The effect of finite band width is estimated from a model assuming low background noise superposed linearly on a delta function spectrum. For narrow band widths one obtains the formula ā2/2m0 = 1 − 0.734$\nu$2, where $\nu$ is the rms spread of the noise about the mean frequency. Values of $\nu$2 corresponding to Pierson-Moskowicz spectra give results in close agreement with observation.},

It is therefore independent of the fourth moment m4, which previously was used to define the spectral width (Cavanie et al. 1976). In the present model the width is defined by the lower-order parameter $\nu$ = (m0 m2/m21-1)1/2. The distribution agrees quite well with wave data taken in the North Atlantic (Chakrabarti & Cooley 1977) and with other data from the Sea of Japan (Goda 1978). Among the features predicted is that the total distribution of wave heights is slightly non-Rayleigh, and that the interquartile range of the conditional wave period distribution tends to zero as the wave amplitude diminishes.

The method is fully nonlinear, and has the advantage of essential simplicity. Both the potential and the kinetic energy involve polynomial expressions of low degree in the Fourier coefficients Yn(t). This leads to equations of motion of correspondingly low degree. Moreover the constants in the equations are very simple. In this paper the equations of motion are specialized to standing waves, where the coefficients Yn are all real. Truncation of the series at low values of &mid;n&mid;, say n < N, leads to {\^{a}}€˜partial waves{\^{a}}€™ with solutions apparently periodic in the time t. For physical applications N must however be large. The method will be applied to the breaking of standing waves by the forming of sharp corners at the crests, and the generation of vertical jets rising from the wave troughs.},

However, as soon as the effect of flow resistance becomes significant, the results obtained are not consistent with observations. This is the case for open channel flows (OCF), in which the water surface is largely influenced by the boundary friction. The roughness generated by the current boundary condition methodologies is solely numerical and cannot be associated to physical values of friction. In light of this challenge, the authors present a novel formulation for the friction boundary condition. The new implementation includes an additional shear stress at the boundaries to reproduce roughness effects, allowing for the adequate three-dimensional simulation of open channel flows using the SPH method. Finally, in order to reduce the high computational cost, typical of the Lagrangian models, without interfering in the representativeness of the SPH simulations, a criterion to define the adequate fluid particle size is proposed.},

Experimental results show that the proposed method which causes the endpoints of robotic fish moving joints not falling on the fitted swimming curve can obtain more accurate swimming motion according to the real fish than that uses the conventional endpoints-on-fitted-curve method. Moreover and thus, using the proposed method the swimming velocity of the robotic fish is improved rapidly.},

 abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. The response of a sandy seabed under wave loading is investigated on the basis of numerical modeling using a multi-scale approach. To that aim, the discrete element method is coupled to a finite volume method specially enhanced to describe compressible fluid flow. Both solid and fluid phase mechanics are upscaled from considerations established at the pore level. Model's predictions are validated against poroelasticity theory and discussed in comparison with experiments where a sediment analog is subjected to wave action in a flume. Special emphasis is put on the mechanisms leading the seabed to liquefy under wave-induced pressure variation on its surface. Liquefaction is observed in both dilative and compactive regimes. It is shown that the instability can be triggered for a well-identified range of hydraulic conditions. Particularly, the results confirm that the gas content, together with the permeability of the medium are key parameters affecting the transmission of pressure inside the soil.},

By itself, this data is subject to significant noise, bias, and drift (without constant re-calibration). A data fusion algorithm can be applied to significantly reduce these errors. In the past, many approaches have been adopted for filtering gyroscope data with inertial measurements, and the most commonly used techniques are Extended Kalman filtering and complementary filters. Thus, this paper compares three methods: two complementary filters known as Madgwick and Mahony, and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

 abstract = {Most of the Earth{\'{s}} surface is covered by water. Many aspects of our everyday lives and activities may be affected by water waves in some way. Sometimes, the waves can cause disaster. One of the examples was the tsunami that occurred in the Indian Ocean on 26 December 2004. This indicates how important it is for us to fully understand water waves, in particular the very large ones. One way to do so is to perform numerical simulation based on the nonlinear theory. Considerable research advances have been made in this area over the past decade by developing various numerical methods and applying them to emerging problems; however, until now there has been no comprehensive book to reflect these advances. This unique volume aims to bridge this gap.\n\nThis book contains 18 self-contained chapters written by more than 50 authors from 12 different countries, many of whom are world-leading experts in the field. Each chapter is based mainly on the pioneering work of the authors and their research teams over the past decades. The chapters altogether deal with almost all numerical methods that have been employed so far to simulate nonlinear water waves and cover many important and very interesting applications, such as overturning waves, breaking waves, waves generated by landslides, freak waves, solitary waves, tsunamis, sloshing waves, interaction of extreme waves with beaches, interaction with fixed structures, and interaction with free-response floating structures. Therefore, this book provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research and key achievements in numerical modeling of nonlinear water waves, and serves as a unique reference for postgraduates, researchers and senior engineers working in industry.},

This feature allows one to use an unstructured mesh with any degree of complexity without the need of regenerating it every time step, which is generally inevitable and very costly. Due to this feature, the QALE-FEM has high potential in enhancing computational efficiency when applied to problems associated with the complex interaction between large steep waves and structures since the use of an unstructured mesh in such a case is likely to be necessary. To achieve overall high efficiency, the numerical techniques involved in the QALE-FEM are developed, including the method to move interior nodes, technique to re-distribute the nodes on the free surface, scheme to calculate velocities and so on. The model is validated by water waves generated by a wavemaker in a tank and the interaction between water waves and periodic bars on the bed of tank. Satisfactory agreement is achieved with analytical solutions, experimental data and numerical results from other methods. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Using learning curves as an analytical tool for technology forecasting involves making assumptions over a range of key uncertainties, often implicitly. In this paper, we present an explicit treatment of the key uncertainties involved in learning rates' analyses of marine energy innovation (wave and tidal stream) - technology fields attracting considerable interest, but whose commercial prospects depends on substantial learning and cost reduction. Taking a simple single factor learning rate model, we describe a range of plausible learning investments required so that marine energy technologies become cost-competitive with their 'benchmark' technology: offshore wind. Our analysis highlights the sensitivity of marine energy to three key parameters: the capital cost of first devices, the level of deployment before sustained cost reduction emerges, and the average rate of cost reduction with deployment (learning rate). Figures often quoted within the marine energy sector for the parameters of starting cost, learning rate, and capacity at which sustained cost reduction occurs (metrics conventionally used for learning rate analysis) can be seen to represent very attractive scenarios. The intention of this paper is to display that even small changes to input assumptions can have a dramatic effect on the overall investment required for a sector to reach parity with benchmark technologies. In the short term, reaching cost competitiveness with offshore wind is a necessity if marine energy is to reach commercialisation. Additionally, an assessment of the plausible total investment (and inherent uncertainties) in a global wave and tidal deployment scenario will be presented. The paper also considers the implications of these uncertainties for marine energy innovation management. While the benchmark against offshore wind will generally be used as a performance indicator, in order to achieve similar and sustained cost reductions to other, more mature, renewable energy technologies (and thus achieve a competitive price for marine technologies, securing their place within the energy mix), the marine energy sector needs a targeted innovation focus to fulfil the desired objectives, and a development pathway very different to offshore wind must be used. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {This report presents a novel orientation filter applicable to IMUs consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and MARG sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion and gyroscope bias drift compensation. The filter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The benefits of the filter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each filter update, (2) effective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters defined by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the filter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; < 0.6◦ static RMS error, < 0.8◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates.},

It is demonstrated that the depth-limitation of the new equations is much less restrictive than for the classical forms of the Boussinesq equations, and it is now possible to simulate the propagation of irregular wave trains travelling from deep water to shallow water. In deep water, the new equations become effectively linear and phase celerities agree with Stokes first-order theory. In more shallow water, the new equations converge towards the standard Boussinesq equations, which are known to provide good results for waves up to at least 75% of their breaking height. A numerical method for solving the new set of equations in two horizontal dimensions is presented. This method is based on a time-centered implicit finite-difference scheme. Finally, model results for wave propagation and diffraction in relatively deep water are presented.},

This work generalizes these earlier works. The solution includes\nexplicit expressions for the surface elevation, the amplitude dispersion\nand the vertical variation of the velocity potential, and it\nincorporates the effect of an ambient current with the option of\nspecifying zero net volume flux. The nonlinear dispersion relation is\ngeneralized to account for many interacting wave components with\ndifferent frequencies and amplitudes, and it is verified against\nclassical expressions from the literature. Limitations and problems with\nthese classical expressions are identified. Next, third-order resonance\ncurves for finite-amplitude carrier waves and their three-dimensional\nperturbations are calculated. The influence of nonlinearity on these\ncurves is demonstrated and a comparison is made with the location of\ndominant class I and class II wave instabilities determined by classical\nstability analyses. Finally, third-order resonance curves for the\ninteraction of nonlinear waves and an undular sea bottom are calculated.\nOn the basis of these curves, the previously observed downshift/upshift\nof reflected/transmitted class III Bragg scatter is, for the first time,\nexplained.},

 abstract = {In the literature it has so far been common practice to consider solitary waves and N-waves (composed of solitary waves) as the appropriate model of tsunamis approaching the shoreline. Unfortunately, this approach is based on a tie between the nonlinearity and the horizontal length scale (or duration) of the wave, which is not realistic for geophysical tsunamis. To resolve this problem, we first derive analytical solutions to the nonlinear shallow-water (NSW) equations for the runup/rundown of single waves, where the duration and the wave height can be specified separately. The formulation is then extended to cover leading depression N-waves composed of a superposition of positive and negative single waves. As a result the temporal variations of the runup elevation, the associated velocity and breaking criteria are specified in terms of polylogarithmic functions. Finally, we consider incoming transient wavetrains generated by monopole and dipole disturbances in the deep ocean. The evolution of these wavetrains, while travelling a considerable distance over a constant depth, is influenced by weak dispersion and is governed by the linear Korteweg-De Vries (KdV) equation. This process is described by a convolution integral involving the Airy function. The runup on the plane sloping beach is then determined by another convolution integral involving the incoming time series at the foot of the slope. A good agreement with numerical model results is demonstrated. Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2010.},

 abstract = {We reconstructed a 2D seismic wavefield and obtained its propagation properties by using the seismic gradiometry method together with dense observations of the Hi-net seismograph network in Japan. The seismic gradiometry method estimates the wave amplitude and its spatial derivative coefficients at any location from a discrete station record by using a Taylor series approximation. From the spatial derivatives in horizontal directions, the properties of a propagating wave packet, including the arrival direction, slowness, geometrical spreading, and radiation pattern can be obtained. In addition, by using spatial derivatives together with free-surface boundary conditions, the 2D vector elastic wavefield can be decomposed into divergence and rotation components. First, as a feasibility test, we performed an analysis with a synthetic seismogram dataset computed by a numerical simulation for a realistic 3D medium and the actual Hi-net station layout. We confirmed that the wave amplitude and its spatial derivatives were very well-reproduced for period bands longer than 25 s. Applications to a real large earthquake showed that the amplitude and phase of the wavefield were well reconstructed, along with slowness vector. The slowness of the reconstructed wavefield showed a clear contrast between body and surface waves and regional non-great-circle-path wave propagation, possibly owing to scattering. Slowness vectors together with divergence and rotation decomposition are expected to be useful for determining constituents of observed wavefields in inhomogeneous media.},

 abstract = {We numerically simulated the propagation of tsunami waves with finite difference methods by using perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary conditions to effectively eliminate artificial reflections from model boundaries. The PML method damps the tsunami height and velocity of seawater only in directions perpendicular to the boundary. Although the additional terms required to implement the PML conditions make the use of the PML technique difficult for linear dispersive tsunami waves, we have proposed an empirical extension of the PML method for modeling dispersive tsunami waves. Even for heterogeneous, realistic bathymetries, numerical tests demonstrated that the PML boundary condition dramatically decreased artificial reflections from model boundaries compared to the use of traditional boundary conditions. The use of PML boundary conditions for numerical modeling of tsunamis is especially useful because it facilitates use of the later phases of tsunamis that would otherwise be compromised by artifacts caused by reflections from model boundaries.},

Ocean energy has attracted increasing interest, particularly in the EU, which is currently at the forefront of ocean energy development. Tidal and Wave energy represents the two most advance types of ocean energy technologies. In the EU, the aim is to reach 100GW of combined wave and tidal capacity installed by 2050. In order to achieve these targets the sector needs to overcome a series of challenges and barriers with regards to technology readiness, financing and market establishment, administrative and environmental issues and the availability of grid connections especially in remote areas. Currently these barriers are hindering the sector's progress; its ability to attract inwards investments and to engage with the supply chain to unlock cost-reduction mechanisms. A number of policy initiatives and mechanisms have been put in place to ensure that ocean energy technologies could become cost-competitive in the short term, in order to exploit the benefits that these technologies could provide to the EU.},

@article{Majdab,
 abstract = {A minimal, nonlinear oscillator model is analyzed for the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) ''skeleton'' (i.e., its fundamental features on intraseasonal/planetary scales), which includes the following: (i) a slow eastward phase speed of roughly 5 m s 21 , (ii) a peculiar dispersion relation with dv/dk ' 0, and (iii) a hori-zontal quadrupole vortex structure. Originally proposed in recent work by the authors, the fundamental mechanism involves neutrally stable interactions between (i) planetary-scale, lower-tropospheric moisture anomalies and (ii) the envelope of subplanetary-scale, convection/wave activity. Here, the model's nonlinear dynamics are analyzed in a series of numerical experiments, using either a uniform sea surface temperature (SST) or a warm-pool SST. With a uniform SST, the results show significant variations in the number, strength, and/or locations of MJO events, including, for example, cases of a strong MJO event followed by a weaker MJO event, similar to the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE). With a warm-pool SST, MJO events often begin as standing os-cillations and then propagate slowly eastward across the warm pool, a behavior imitating MJOs in nature. While displaying the fundamental features of the MJO skeleton, these MJO events had significant variations in their lifetimes and regional extents, and they displayed intense, irregular fluctuations in their amplitudes. The model reproduces all of these features of the MJO skeleton without including mechanisms for the MJO's ''muscle,'' such as refined vertical structure and upscale convective momentum transport from subplanetary-scale convection/waves. Besides these numerical experiments, it is also shown that the nonlinear model conserves a total energy that includes a contribution from the convective activity.},

The robot employs a compliant body with embedded actuators emulating the slender anatomical form of a fish. In addition, the robot has a novel fluidic actuation system that drives body motion and has all the subsystems of a traditional robot onboard: power, actuation, processing, and control. At the core of the fish's soft body is an array of fluidic elastomer actuators. We design the fish to emulate escape responses in addition to forward swimming because such maneuvers require rapid body accelerations and continuum-body motion. These maneuvers showcase the performance capabilities of this self-contained robot. The kinematics and controllability of the robot during simulated escape response maneuvers are analyzed and compared with studies on biological fish. We show that during escape responses, the soft-bodied robot has similar input-output relationships to those observed in biological fish. The major implication of this work is that we show soft robots can be both self-contained and capable of rapid body motion.},

This is exacerbating the challenge of setting up simulations for industrial applications. The literature on input parameter selection is divided. A number of papers report methods for their direct measurement. Others, by contrast, propose a “calibration” approach where the particle properties are derived as adjustable parameters by quantitative comparison of experimental and simulation results. This paper reports on the calibration and validation of the input parameters for the specific case of cylindrical tablets represented by conjoined spheres. The initial steps are to not only assign and optimise the DEM input parameters but also optimise the shape representation; what degree of linearity of the edges and angularity of the corners are required to accurately reflect the cylindrical shape. The model was used to simulate two configurations of a rotating drum: an “attrition tester” with a single longitudinal baffle and an un-baffled drum. The results were compared qualitatively and quantitatively with experimental data. While the qualitative comparison was good in most cases, detailed quantitative comparison fared less well, with some significant errors. This study highlights some of the key issues for a wider-spread of industrial applications for DEM.},

Here, we analyse a robotic fish and individual golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas) swimming together in a water tunnel at different flow velocities. We determine the positional preference of fish with respect to the robot, and we study the flow structure using a digital particle image velocimetry system. We find that biomimetic locomotion is a determinant of fish preference as fish aremore attracted towards the robot when its tail is beating rather than when it is statically immersed in the water as a 'dummy'. At specific conditions, the fish hold station behind the robot, which may be due to the hydrodynamic advantage obtained by swimming in the robot's wake.

Since the proposed algorithms are based on SPH interpolations their implementation does not require complex geometrical procedures. Thus the free-surface detection can be easily embedded in SPH solvers, without a significant increase of the CPU time. Throughout this procedure accurate normal vectors to the free-surface are made available. Then it is possible to define a level-set function algorithm which is presented in detail. The latter allows in-depth analyses of three-dimensional free-surface simulations by using standard visualization tools, including internal features of the flow. The algorithms proposed for detecting free-surface particles and defining the level-set function are validated on simple and complex twoand three-dimensional flow simulations. The usefulness of the proposed procedures to post-process and analyze complex flows are illustrated on realistic examples. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Settlement of wave-dissipating blocks in front of caisson is caused by displacement and breakage of blocks directly by wave action and also by sliding of the caisson by wave force. The settlement of blocks, caisson sliding and wave pressure are mutually correlated. The present study has developed a stability analysis method for a composite breakwater with wave-dissipating blocks under the circumstances of climate change effect as seen in sea level rise and increase in storm surges and waves. It is found that the changes of expected caisson sliding distance and necessary caisson width, determined from the allowable excess probabilities for three prescribed sliding distances, against the weight of wave-dissipating block have a tendency to be maximum at certain block weight when repairing of damaged blocks is not done; on the other hand, if repairing is done every time after reaching 5% damage level of the total section, the changes of caisson sliding distance and necessary caisson width against the block weight show monotonous decrease. The effects of climate change on the sliding distance and necessary width are found to make those values larger by 10-60% than those calculated by constant external forces given from the present climate conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a new particle method for numerical simulation of droplet dynamics. In the proposed method, the moving surface mesh is used to define interface between gas and liquid. The volume enclosed by the mesh represents the liquid droplet, and the outer domain is inactive gas with constant pressure. The incompressible liquid flow is calculated using a particle method, in which spatial derivatives are evaluated using an arbitrary high order accurate scheme. On the free surface, the surface stress balance equations, including surface tension and viscous stress, are adopted for the boundary conditions. Deformation of the gas-liquid interface is explicitly calculated by surface nodes that move in a Lagrangian fashion. Surface tension force is directly evaluated with high accuracy on each node utilizing the mesh shape. As numerical verification, simulations of three benchmark problems, namely circular patch test, Laplace pressure test and 2D droplet (liquid column) oscillation problems with different oscillation modes, have been carried out. The computation results were compared with the theoretical solutions, and excellent agreements were obtained. As a result, high accuracy and validity of the proposed computational method were confirmed.},

Methods Fluids 71(4), 446–472, 2012) presented a novel approach using a renormalization factor in the SPH approximation. The computation of this factor depends on an integral along the boundary of the domain and in their original paper Ferrand et al. gave an analytical formulation for the 2-D case using the Wendland kernel. In this paper the formulation will be extended to 3-D, again providing analytical formulae. Due to the boundary being two dimensional a domain decomposition algorithm needs to be employed in order to obtain special integration domains. For these the analytical formulae will be presented when using the Wendland kernel. The algorithm presented within this paper is applied to several academic test-cases for which either analytical results or simulations with other methods are available. It will be shown that the present formulation produces accurate results and provides a significant improvement compared to approximative methods.},

Due to the lack of in situ measurements a suite of numerical models are used to assess the wave energy between 2009 and 2010. We compare the effects of different wind forcing reanalysis, particularly CFSR and ERA-Interim, and physics parametrizations on numerical simulations of the nearshore wave energy fluxes near Valparaiso (33 S), central Chile. For this we utilize WAVEWATCH III {\textregistered} , an open source community spectral wave model, configured with a high resolution unstructured grid (200e400 m at the coast). Our results show a difference of 3 kW/m in wave power estimations when using different wind reanalysis, and less a difference of less than 0.5 kW/m when adding the triad wave interactions term. Statistical indicators calculated using buoy and altimeter data for comparison favor the use of ERA-Interim winds and including triad wave interactions. For the Valparaiso region, the area south of Punta Curaumilla was confirmed as a hot spot of wave energy (4e5 MW/yr), with the most energetic and frequent sea state described by Te of 9e11 s and H_s 2.5e3.5 m.},

With the basic assumption that the depth is small in comparison with a horizontal length scale, three regimes of approximation are presented according to the magnitude of the wave amplitude, (a) When the amplitude is of the same order of magnitude as the depth, the Airy equations are rederived as the first approximation, (b) When the amplitude is comparable to the cube of the depth, both lengths being nondimensionalized with respect to a common horizontal scale, two high-order nonlinear equations are obtained which include the classical cnoidal wave as a special solution for a horizontal bottom. These equations may be transformed to a set of first-order quasi-linear hyperbolic equations with the characteristic curves in the x-t plane directly related to the bottom profile. To facilitate numerical computations they are then written as differential equations along the characteristics. In the third regime (c) of extremely small wave amplitudes the appropriate linearized equations are given.},

 abstract = {There are several specific solutions for accessing sensors and actuators present in any process or system through a TCP/IP network, either local or a wide area type like the Internet. The usage of sensors and actuators of different nature and diverse interfaces (SPI, I2C, analogue, etc.) makes access to them from a network in a homogeneous and secure way more complex. A framework, including both software and hardware resources, is necessary to simplify and unify networked access to these devices. In this paper, a set of open-source software tools, specifically designed to cover the different issues concerning the access to sensors and actuators, and two proposed low-cost hardware architectures to operate with the abovementioned software tools are presented. They allow integrated and easy access to local or remote sensors and actuators. The software tools, integrated in the free authoring tool Easy Java and Javascript Simulations (EJS) solve the interaction issues between the subsystem that integrates sensors and actuators into the network, called convergence subsystem in this paper, and the Human Machine Interface (HMI)—this one designed using the intuitive graphical system of EJS—located on the user's computer. The proposed hardware architectures and software tools are described and experimental implementations with the proposed tools are presented.},

 abstract = {One of the greatest challenges of coastal engineering today is the need for coastal protection in the changing climate scenario. Places which are nowadays protected will demand upgraded defences and more sites will require security; in all cases a large amount of resources will be needed to ensure beach maintenance and coastal safety. This may be an opportunity for the multi-purpose use of Wave Energy Converters (WECs) if the foreseen increase of energy demand in coastal areas is also considered. In this paper a group of WECs based on different operating concepts is numerically tested in front of two beaches, i.e. the Bay of Santander in Spain and Las Glorias beach in Mexico, representing two different case studies where the long-shore sediment transport is dominant. The hydrodynamics induced by these devices is represented by means of a 2D elliptic modified mild-slope model that is calibrated against new experimental results. The wave field is then used as input for the analytical calculation of the long-shore sediment transport and the coastline trend is estimated by applying the continuity of sediment equation. The characteristics of the selected numerical models give this work a first approach level. All the devices were found to produce a positive trend (accretion) at least in small areas. Recommendations are given to facilitate the selection of the device and the design of the farm layout for shore protection purpose. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {The surface-wave response of a harbour to a prescribed, incident wave is calculated on the hypotheses of shallow-water theory, an ideal fluid, and a narrow mouth, M. An equivalent electrical circuit is constructed, in which the incidentwave displacement in M appears as the input voltage and the flow through M appears as the input current. This circuit contains a radiation impedance, ZM, which comprises resistive and inductive terms, and a harbour impedance, ZH, which comprises an infinite sequence of parallel combinations of inductance and capacitance that bear a one-to-one correspondence with the natural modes of the closed harbour, together with a single capacitor, which corresponds to the degenerate mode of uniform displacement and dominates the response of the harbour as a Helmholtz resonator. Variational approximations to ZH and ZM are developed. The equivalent circuit exhibits parallel resonance at the resonant frequencies of the closed harbour, $\omega$n, and series resonance at a second set of frequencies, $\omega$$\sim$n, where $\omega$$\sim$n↓$\omega$n>0 and $\omega$$\sim$0↓0 as M [rightward arrow] 0; $\omega$$\sim$0 corresponds to the Helmholtz mode. A narrow canal between the coastline and the harbour is represented by a four-terminal network between ZM and ZH. It is shown that narrowing the harbour mouth and/or increasing the length of the canal does not affect the mean response of the harbour to a broad-band, random input except in the Helmholtz mode, but that it does increase significantly the response in that mode, which may dominate tsunami response. The general results are applied to circular and rectangular harbours. The numerical calculation of ZH for an arbitrarily shaped harbour is discussed.},

Fourier transformation along the contours of constant depth, which are assumed parallel to a straight coastline, yields a Sturm-Liouville equation for a prescribed depth profile h(x). The modal spectrum of the profile, which comprises a finite, discrete spectrum of trapped modes and a continuous spectrum of radiated modes, is established. The Green's function for a point source on the coastline is constructed by Fourier superposition over this spectrum. Detailed results are calculated for a two-step model (level shelf separated from level abyss by vertical cliff) and for a gradually sloping shelf that merges smoothly into a level abyss.

The resulting equations are equivalent to those of Green & Naghdi (1976). The conservation laws for energy, momentum and potential vorticity are inferred directly from symmetries of the Lagrangian. The potential vorticity vanishes in any flow that originates from rest ; this leads to a canonical formulation in which the evolution equations are equivalent, for uniform depth, to Whitham's (1967) generalization of the Boussinesq equations, in which dispersion, but not nonlinearity, is assumed to be weak. The further approximation that nonlinearity and dispersion are comparably weak leads to a canonical form of Boussinesq's equations that conserves consistent approximations to energy, momentum (for a level bottom) and potential vorticity.},

The result shows strong seasonal fluctuation in which the wave power during winter monsoon is much higher than other seasons. Additionally, the wave power also fluctuates inter-annually due to the El Ni??o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It was revealed that wave power along the northern section of the coast is more energetic than the southern region, with mean annual of 4 and 2.5kW/m, respectively. The significant difference between the two regions is due to the sheltering effects of the multiple islands. The 5% exceedance values, which represent the highest wave power, range from 8 to 15kW/m and 1.5 to 4.2kW/m for the northern and southern sections of the coast, respectively. It was also found that the bulk of the wave energy flux is generated by waves with significant wave height between 1 to 3m and mean wave energy periods between 6 to 9s. Generally, with efficient wave energy converters, the renewable wave energy can be viable to be harvested, particularly in the northern region during winter monsoon period. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The model was forced by Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) winds and ETOPO2 bathymetry data. The highest annual wave power can be found in the northern region of the study area with amplitudes exceeding 20 kW/m. The values decrease gradually towards the Sunda Shelf and reach to their minimum at coastal regions due to bathymetry complexity, shadowing and island obstruction effects. However, the wave power is strongly influenced by seasonality and inter-annual fluctuation. Nine sites representing different sub-regions were selected for further analysis on eligibility of wave farming. Various wave energy statistics including estimated electric power for a number of Wave Energy Converter (WEC) devices showed some stations (Hameau Mo in Vietnamese east coast, Spratly Island, Palawan and Cape Bolinao in west coast of Luzon) have greater eligibility for wave power farming.

 abstract = {The wind blowing over sea surface generates tiny wind waves. They develop with time and space absorbing wind energy, and become huge wind waves usually referred to ocean surface waves. The wind waves cause not only serious sea disasters but also take important roles in the local and global climate changes by affecting the fluxes of momentum, heat and gases (e.g. CO 2) through the air-sea boundary. The present paper reviews the selected studies on wind waves conducted by our group in the Research Institute for Applied Mechanics (RIAM), Kyushu University. The themes discussed are interactions between water waves and winds, the energy spectrum of wind waves, nonlinear properties of wind waves, and the effects of surfactant on some air-sea interaction phenomena.},

@article{Mittal2005,
 abstract = {The term immersed boundary methodwas first used in reference to a method de- veloped by Peskin (1972) to simulate cardiac mechanics and associated blood flow. The distinguishing feature of this methodwas that the entire simulationwas carried out on a Cartesian grid, which did not conform to the geometry of the heart, and a novel procedurewas formulated for imposing the effect of the immersed boundary (IB) on the flow. Since Peskin introduced this method, numerous modifications and refinements have been proposed and a number of variants of this approach nowex- ist. In addition, there is another class of methods, usually referred to as Cartesian grid methods, which were originally developed for simulating inviscid flows with complex embedded solid boundaries on Cartesian grids (Berger&Aftosmis 1998, Clarke et al. 1986, Zeeuw & Powell 1991). These methods have been extended to simulate unsteady viscous flows (Udaykumar et al. 1996, Ye et al. 1999) and thus have capabilities similar to those of IB methods. In this review, we use the term im- mersed boundary (IB) method to encompass all such methods that simulate viscous flows with immersed (or embedded) boundaries on grids that do not conform to the shape of these boundaries. Furthermore, this review focuses mainly on IB meth- ods for flows with immersed solid boundaries. Application of these and related methods to problems with liquid-liquid and liquid-gas boundaries was covered in previous reviews by Anderson et al. (1998) and Scardovelli & Zaleski (1999). Consider the simulation of flow past a solid body shown in Figure 1a. The conventional approach to this would employ structured or unstructured grids that conform to the body. Generating these grids proceeds in two sequential steps. First, a surface grid covering the boundaries b is generated. This is then used as a boundary condition to generate a grid in the volumef occupied by the fluid. If a finite-difference method is employed on a structured grid, then the differential form of the governing equations is transformed to a curvilinear coordinate system aligned with the grid lines (Ferziger & Peric 1996). Because the grid conforms to the surface of the body, the transformed equations can then be discretized in the 0066-4189/05/0115-0239$14.00 239 Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 2005.37:239-261.

 abstract = {Renewable energy, such as wave energy, plays a significant role in sustainable energy development. Wave energy represents a large untapped source of energy worldwide and potentially offers a vast source of sustainable energy. We present models and a heuristic algorithm for choosing optimal locations of wave energy conversion (WEC) devices within an array, or wave farm. The location problem can have a significant impact on the total power of the farm due to the interactions among the incident ocean waves and the scattered and radiated waves produced by the WECs. Depending on the nature of the interference (constructive or destructive) among these waves, the wave energy entering multiple devices, and thus the power output of the farm, may be significantly larger or smaller than the energy that would be seen if the devices were operating in isolation. Our algorithm chooses WEC locations to maximize the performance of a wave farm as measured by a well known performance measure called the q-factor, which is the ratio of the power from an array of N WECs to the power from N WECs operating independently, under the point absorber approximation. We prove an analytical optimal solution for the 2-WEC problem and, based on the properties of the 2-WEC solution, we propose an iterative heuristic optimization algorithm for the general problem.},

 abstract = {Wind-induced wave characteristics are one of the most important factors in the design of coastal and marine structures. Therefore, accurate estimation of wave parameters is of considerable importance. The wave climate study can be conducted by ?eld measurements, empirical studies, physical modeling and numerical simulations. In this paper, the skill of a third-generation spectral model called SWAN has been evaluated in the prediction of wave parameters. The varying wind and wave climate of Lake Erie in the year 2002 has been used for evaluation of the model. The signi?cant wave height (Hs) and the peak spectral wave period (Tp) were the parameters employed in the study and the model has been executed in a nonstationary mode. The linear and exponential growth from wind input, four-wave nonlinear interaction, whitecapping and bottom friction have been considered in the simulation. The results of this study show that in the investigated case, the average scatter index of SWAN is about 19 percent for signi?cant wave height and 23 percent for the peak period. The error of the SWAN model in prediction of the wave height and period reduced about 3 percent after elimination of wave heights less than 0.5 meters. It was also found that using the cumulative steepness method for whitecapping dissipation yields worse results for signi?cant wave height and better results for peak spectral period estimation. After using this method, the average scatter index for the prediction of Hs increased about 5 percent and decreased more than 4 percent for Tp. It should be mentioned that the computational time required by using this method is approximately more than twice that of the Komen option},

When the velocity of the advancing ship hull is non-negligible, the semi-Lagrangian formulation (also known as Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation or ALE) of the free-surface equations contains dominant transport terms which are stabilized with a streamwise upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method. The SUPG stabilization allows automatic and robust adaptation of the spatial discretization with unstructured quadrilateral grids. Preliminary results are presented where we compare our numerical model with experimental results on a Wigley hull advancing in calm water with fixed sink and trim. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Molin2001,
 abstract = {So-called 'moonpools' are vertical openings through the deck and hull of ships or barges, used for marine and offshore operations, such as pipe laying or recovery of divers. In the present study rectangular moonpools of large horizontal dimensions are considered. The natural modes of oscillation of the inner free surfaces are determined, under the assumption of infinite water depth and infinite length and beam of the barges that contain the moonpools. The problem is treated in two and three dimensions, via linearized potential flow theory. Results are given for the natural frequencies and the associated shapes of the free surface, for wide ranges of the geometric parameters. Simple quasi-analytical approximations are derived that yield the natural frequencies. The most striking result is that the natural frequencies of the longitudinal sloshing modes increase without bounds when both the draught and the width decrease to zero, the length of the moonpool being kept constant. As a corollary the problem of waves travelling in a channel through a rigid ice sheet is addressed and their dispersion equation is derived. The same behaviour is obtained: the waves travel increasingly faster as both the draught and the width of the channel are reduced.},

 abstract = {In literature, it is well know that the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method can be affected by numerical noise on the pressure field when dealing with liquids. This can be highly dangerous when an SPH code is dynamically coupled with a structural solver. In this work a simple procedure is proposed to improve the computation of the pressure distribution in the dynamics of liquids. Such a procedure is based on the use of a density diffusion term in the equation for the mass conservation. This diffusion is a pure numerical effect, similar to the well known artificial viscosity originally proposed in SPH method to smooth out the shock discontinuities. As the artificial viscosity, the density diffusion used here goes to zero increasing the number of particles recovering consistency and convergence of the final numerical scheme adopted. Different artificial density diffusion formulas have been studied, paying attention to prevent unphysical changes of the flows. To show the improvements of the new scheme proposed here, a suitable set of examples, for which reference solutions or experimental data are available, has been tested. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {In this work, we propose a two-way coupling technique between a total Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method for Solid Mechanics and the explicit incompressible SPH (EISPH) to simulate fluid–structure interaction problems. In the solid part, the total Lagrangian framework guarantees that the particle distribution keep stable to correctly calculate the deformation gradient and thus the elastic forces. The constitutive model follows hyperelastic formulations, and the stability of the method is enforced by a Jameson–Schmidt–Turkel (JST) stabilization procedure. For the fluid part, we applied an EISPH formulation, which is a fully explicit incompressible scheme based on a projection method capable of providing accurate pressure distributions for free-surface flows, while avoiding costly linear equations. The coupling scheme follows the same manner as the fixed wall ghost particle (FWGP) approach, which was here adapted to include moving walls. In addition, the non-penetration condition is rigorously reinforced through a numerical algorithm to avoid penetration of every fluid particle, including free-surface particles. Our method for solid is then verified through a large deformed tension plate numerical test, and our coupling forces through a series floating tests and hydrostatic water column over a thin infinite plate. Then, the method is validated comparing it with experimental data of a dam break test in which the water column attacks a thin rubber plate.},

@article{Morikawa2023,
 abstract = {It is well-known in the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) community that correction in the gradient and Laplacian operators have the potential to drastically increase the accuracy of the method at the expense of computational stability. This paper proposes a stable implementation of such corrections in all derivative operators to the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian incompressible SPH (ALE-ISPH) method, in addition to a novel Neumann boundary condition (BC) applied directly on the velocity (as opposed to traditional BCs where the constraint is applied on the acceleration). In this way, the pressure is solved for both water and wall particles simultaneously, leading to a pressure field that obeys non-penetration BC and divergence-free at the same time. Furthermore, to stabilize the method, we have developed a novel density-based particle shifting technique (PST), specifically designed to deal with incompressible fluids. In this formulation, the numerical density is given as one of the most critical constraint variables. As a result, the proposed density-based PST can maintain the fluid's overall volume for the whole simulation. In addition, it also provides numerical stability as it prevents particle clustering and leads the fluid domain to an isotropic composition. First, we verified the proposed corrected formulation with the novel Neumann BC for both non-penetration and non-slip conditions with the simulation of hydrostatic pressure and Poisenuille flow, respectively. Then, we tested the proposed density-based PST with the rotating square patch problem with results comparable to previous studies. Lastly, we verified the proposed method for the dam break with an obstacle test, a highly dynamic problem.},

 abstract = {In this study, a long-term assessment of the wave energy resource potential for the Australian southeast shelf is performed from deep to shallow water, based on a 31-year wave hindcast. The hindcast, covering the period from 1979 to 2010, has been performed at high spatio-temporal resolution with the wave energy transformation model SWAN using calibrated source-term parameters. The model has been applied with a variable spatial resolution of up to approximately 500 m and at 1 h temporal resolution and driven with high-resolution, non-stationary CFSR wind fields and full 2D spectral boundary conditions from WaveWatch III model. Model validation was conducted against wave measurements from multiple buoy sites covering 10–31 years and showed a relatively high correlation between hindcast and measured significant wave height (Hs) and mean wave direction ($\theta$m). Maps of wave power resource distribution for annual and seasonal mean potential were generated along with the maps of resource reliability and variability. The high resolution allowed us to perform in-depth analysis of wave power characteristics, providing resource knowledge on seasonal and longer-term variability necessary for reliable and optimal design of wave technology. The most promising area for wave power exploitation was found to be the central coast of New South Wales, where various high-energy hotspots were selected for a further analysis. For each of the considered hotspots, the wave power magnitude, variability and consistency were carefully assessed and characterized by means of sea state parameters and mean wave directions. Finally, estimates of electric power outputs from different types of pre-commercial wave energy converter devices were drawn for each hotspot based on the wave data hindcast and discussed.},

 abstract = {A first assessment of the potential wake impact of the future Princess Elisabeth wind-farm cluster on the existing Belgian wind farms is performed. We consider 3 different wake models coupled to a blockage model implemented in FLORIS, and study 15 design scenarios for the future cluster. Simulations show that, although intra-cluster wake effects are qualitatively comparable, inter-cluster effects differ strongly among model setups, confirming results in recent literature. With increasing new-zone capacity, a trend of higher existing-zone AEP loss caused by the new zone is observed, as well as an incentive to use turbines with higher individual rating. Quantitatively, AEP loss due to inter-cluster wakes can reach up to 0.8% for the full existing zone as compared to a reference case without the Princess Elisabeth zone. Further, worst-case conditions with west-southwesterly winds show the new zone induces an inter-cluster power loss of 6% for the entire existing zone, with extremes up to 20% for specific turbines.},

Since Gamma CDF is an infinite power series, further mathematical treatment is difficult. Hence its shape parameter is approximated to the nearest integer to arrive at Erlang distribution. An expression is derived from Erlang distribution to estimate various mean wave periods and significant wave period and validated by relative root mean square (RRMS) error criteria. It is shown by mathematical logic that the significant wave period distribution follows Erlang (or Gamma) distribution and is validated. The average of one-third and one-tenth highest wave periods (T s) estimated from Erlang distribution are in accordance with the values computed from recorded buoy and numerical coastal wave model wave period data. The predicted T s values from coastal wave model wave period data underestimates the values from buoy wave period data.},

Recent research conducted on wave energy invention has opened a new dimension to slowly reduce the dependency on fossil fuel by introducing new technology on the renewable world but relatively lacking in economical aspect. This review brings the latest status on integration of wave energy device with other marine facilities, which is the breakwater structure that may possibly aid to cost sharing. Most researches done on this field highlighted countries experiencing rough sea condition and focused less on countries with medium wave condition as faced by the Asian continent. The potential for energy extraction and wave dissipation for medium wave condition will be discussed in this review by considering several aspects including reliability, effectiveness and performance. Finally, this review shows that the integration opens up a new dimension to acknowledge the technology harnessing ocean wave, especially for the Asian countries experiencing medium wave condition.},

@article{Nakanishi2020,
 abstract = {We introduce a novel liquid simulation approach that combines a spatially adaptive pressure projection solver with the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method. The solver relies on a generalized version of the Finite Difference (FD) method to approximate the pressure field and its gradients in tree-based grid discretizations, possibly non-graded. In our approach, FD stencils are computed by using meshfree interpolations provided by a variant of Radial Basis Function (RBF), known as RBF-Finite-Difference (RBF-FD). This meshfree version of the FD produces differentiation weights on scattered nodes with high-order accuracy. Our method adapts a quadtree/octree dynamically in a narrow-band around the liquid interface, providing an adaptive particle sampling for the PIC advection step. Furthermore, RBF affords an accurate scheme for velocity transfer between the grid and particles, keeping the system's stability and avoiding numerical dissipation. We also present a data structure that connects the spatial subdivision of a quadtree/octree with the topology of its corresponding dual-graph. Our data structure makes the setup of stencils straightforward, allowing its updating without the need to rebuild it from scratch at each time-step. We show the effectiveness and accuracy of our solver by simulating incompressible inviscid fluids and comparing results with regular PIC-based solvers available in the literature.},

 abstract = {The oblique reflection of an incident internal solitary wave is investigated using a fully-nonlinear and strongly-dispersive internal wave model. The 3rd order theoretical solution for an internal solitary wave in a two-layer system is used for the incident solitary wave. Two different incident wave amplitude cases are investigated, in which nine and eleven different incident angles are used for the small and large incident amplitude cases respectively. Under both amplitudes, at least for the cases investigated here, relatively smaller incident angles result in Mach reflection while relatively larger incident angles result in regular reflection. Under Mach-like reflection generation of a ‘stem' is observed for a certain range of incident angles, in addition to the reflected wave. The stem is found to have, in a certain sense, the characteristics of an internal solitary wave, though the maximum stem wave amplitude is less than four times as large as the original incident internal solitary wave. The stem length is confirmed to increase faster for the larger incident wave amplitude. The maximum amplification factor for the small incident wave is the same as in previous studies. However, the maximum amplification factor for the large incident wave is less than that for the small wave. The results of these calculations are compared with those of the corresponding KP theory and it is found that a lower amplification factor may be a significant characteristic of internal solitary waves.},

 abstract = {High-order velocity and pressure boundary conditions are presented in Eulerian incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (ISPH). While the high-order convergence of Eulerian ISPH has been demonstrated by the authors for periodic internal flows using Gaussian kernels this was limited by first to second-order accuracy for cases with solid boundaries. Since the SPH interpolation method is numerically robust there is potential for obtaining high-order accuracy in topologically complex domains with robust high-order accurate boundary conditions. In this paper high-order finite-difference extrapolation methods at solid boundaries are developed in Eulerian ISPH to allow for enforcement of the Dirichlet boundary condition for velocity and the Neumann boundary condition for pressure with high-order accuracy. Convergence up to fourth-order is demonstrated for 2-D Taylor-Couette flow and 3-D simulations of Taylor-Couette cellular flow structures are used to demonstrate accuracy and robustness. The order of accuracy may be extended to even higher-order using the analysis presented. Compact fourth-order Wendland-type kernels have also been derived to reduce the particle support region thereby lowering computational effort without loss of high-order convergence. The proposed formulation is therefore entirely high order.},

@article{New1985,
 abstract = {The numerical method of Longuet-Higgins & Cokelet (1976), for waves on deep water, is extended to account for a horizontal bottom contour, and used to investigate breaking waves in water of finite depth. It is demonstrated that a variety of overturning motions may be generated, ranging from the projection of a small-scale jet at the wave crest (of the type that might initiate a spilling breaker) to large-scale plunging breakers involving a significant portion of the wave. Although there seems to be a continuous transition between these wave types, a remarkable similarity is noticed in the overturning regions of many of the waves. Three high-resolution computations are also discussed. The results are presented in the form of interrelated space-, velocity- and acceleration-plane plots which enable the time evolution of individual fluid particles to be followed. These computations should be found useful for the testing of analytical theories, and may also be applied, for example, to studies of slamming forces on shipping and coastal structures.},

 abstract = {Wave-drift damping results from low-frequency oscillatory motions of a floating body, in the presence of an incident wave field. Previous works have analysed this effect in a quasi-steady manner, based on the rate of change of the added resistance in waves, with respect to a small steady forward velocity. In this paper the wave- drift damping coefficient is derived more directly, from a perturbation analysis where the low-frequency body oscillations are superposed on the diffraction field. Unlike the case of body oscillations in calm water, where the damping due to wave radiation is asymptotically small for low frequencies, the superposition of oscillatory motions on the diffraction field results in an order-one damping coefficient. All three degrees of freedom are considered in the horizontal plane. The resulting matrix of damping coefficients is derived from pressure integration on the body, and transformed in special cases to a far-field control surface.},

The force is evaluated directly from pressure integration over the cylinder, and the second-order potential is derived by Weber transformation of the corresponding forcing function on the free surface. This forcing function is reduced to a form which involves a simple factor inversely proportional to the radial coordinate plus an oscillatory function which decays more rapidly in the far field. This feature alleviates the slow rate of convergence involved in capturing the far-field effect. Benchmark computations are obtained and compared with other works. Asymptotic approximations are derived for long and short wavelengths. The analysis and results are primarily for the case of infinite fluid depth, but the finite-depth case is also considered to facilitate comparison with other computations and to illustrate the importance of finite-depth effects in the long-wavelength asymptotic regime.},

 abstract = {We analyze the conditioning properties of classical shape-perturbation methods for the prediction of scattering returns from rough surfaces. A central observation relates to the identification of significant cancellations that are present in the recurrence relations satisfied by successive terms in a perturbation series. We show that these cancellations are precisely responsible for the observed performance of shape-deformation methods, which typically deteriorates with decreasing regularity of the scattering surfaces. We further demonstrate that the cancellations preclude a straightforward recursive estimation of the size of the terms in the perturbation series, which, in turn, has historically prevented the derivation of a direct proof of its convergence. On the other hand, we also show that such a direct proof can be attained if a simple change of independent variables is effected in advance of the derivation of the perturbation series. Finally, we show that the relevance of these observations goes beyond the theoretical, as we explain how they provide definite guiding principles for the design of new, stabilized implementations of methods based on shape deformations.},

 abstract = {In this paper we establish the existence and analyticity of periodic solutions of a classical free-boundary model of the evolution of three-dimensional, capillary–gravity waves on the surface of an ideal fluid. The result is achieved through the application of bifurcation theory to a boundary perturbation formulation of the problem, and it yields analyticity jointly with respect to the perturbation parameter and the spatial variables. The travelling waves we find can be interpreted as resulting from the (nonlinear) interaction of two two-dimensional wavetrains, giving rise to a periodic travelling pattern. Our analyticity theorem extends the most sophisticated results known to date in the absence of resonance; 'short crested waves', which result from the interaction of two wavetrains with unit amplitude ratio are realized as a special case. Our method of proof also sheds light on the convergence and conditioning properties of classical boundary perturbation methods for the numerical approximation of travelling surface waves. Indeed, we demonstrate that the rather unstable numerical behaviour of these approaches can be attributed to the strong but subtle cancellations in the formulas underlying their classical implementations. These observations motivate the derivation and use of an alternative, stable, formulation which, in addition to providing our method of proof, suggests new stabilized implementations of boundary perturbation algorithms.},

From a mathematical perspective, these equations present rather unique challenges for analysis and simulation as they couple the subtleties of nonlinear wave equations (balancing nonlinearity with dispersion in the absence of dissipation) to the difficulties of free-boundary problems. In this paper a new, stable high-order boundary perturbation algorithm for the numerical simulation of traveling water waves is described. Its performance is compared to that of classical surface deformation algorithms and it is shown that the new scheme displays significantly enhanced conditioning properties and a lower computational cost, which enable very accurate predictions of physical observables such as velocity, energy, height/steepness, and shape. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier SAS.

 abstract = {England and Wales has a long history of recognising coastal change, where coastal morphology adjusts in response to changing patterns of erosion and accretion, especially in the vicinity of ports and reclamations in estuaries. The long history of responses to coastal change can be linked to the history of coastal engineering, the wider development of coastal management; and most recently shoreline management, as a policy framework for managing flood and erosion risks on changing coasts. Coastal change is ongoing and long-term so that management is necessarily a process and effective delivery requires an adequate monitoring programme to inform management decisions. Monitoring also enables adaptive and flexible solutions to be implemented that take account of the inherent uncertainties such as future climate, promoting well adapted rather than mal-adapted outcomes. Given the current concerns about accelerated rates of sea-level rise and climate change this paper considers the development of both shoreline management and the supporting national monitoring programme in England to assess whether the SMP process remains useful in these circumstances. The lessons and experience are widely transferable. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {During the last decades more and more wind farms have been erected offshore. Most of these wind farms are located at relatively shallow water. The majority of the offshore wind turbines are founded on monopiles. Many of these offshore wind farms are exposed to large and steep waves, in some cases even breaking waves. The loads on the piles caused by waves can be significant and a better knowledge of the forcing caused by real sea states, including irregular waves and directional spreading is required to optimize the design. The present physical model tests have been conducted in order to determine the effects of wave directionality and breaking of irregular waves. Piles with and without secondary structures have been tested. The waves were shoaled over a sloping bed and the pile was placed at two different positions with varying bed slopes. The three forcing components (Fx, Fy, Fz) were measured at the bottom of the pile during the experiments. Breaking waves occurred around the pile in most of the tests and significant slamming forces were observed in the cases where breaking waves hit the pile which is well known from the literature. The experimental results indicated that the slamming force may be reduced when the wave spreading is increased, similar to the case of non-breaking waves. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 by ASME.},

The resulting numerical equation is solved with GMRES (generalised minimum residual method) in connection with FMM (fast multipole method). It is found that the obtained code is faster than a conventional one when the number of unknowns is greater than about 1300. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {This study is concerned with the Green function of the theory of potential flow about a body in regular (time-harmonic) water waves in deep water, that is with the linearized velocity potential of the flow due to a source of pulsating strength at a fixed position below the free surface (or a pulsating flux across the free surface) of a quiescent infinitely deep sea. An asymptotic expansion and a convergent ascending-series expansion for the Green function are obtained from two alternative complementary ‘near-field' and ‘far-field' single-integral representations in terms of the exponential integral. The asymptotic expansion and the ascending series allow efficient numerical evaluation of the Green function for large and small distances, respectively, from the mirror image of the singularity (submerged source or free-surface flux) with respect to the mean sea surface.},

 abstract = {We present the numerical modeling of a heaving, point-source wave energy conversion (WEC) device, previously tested by the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The WEC device converts the vertical heave displacements into a rotational motion to generate electrical power; the heave displacements converted are from the WEC system rising with the incoming waves relative to an anchoring system. Two anchoring methods of the WEC device are referred to as the single-body case (moored system) and double-body case (drogue anchored system). The numerical model performs hydrodynamic analysis in the time domain in irregular seas for the single-body or double-body case. We then compare the predictions with the available in-ocean experiments. The computer program written for this purpose solves for the individual body motion and predicts the WEC device's power production over the time series. Moreover, we present the results of the study that shows the effect of the device-damping characteristics and the size and the depth of operation of the drogue on wave-power predictions},

@article{Nomeritae2016a,
 abstract = {Several numerical schemes are available to simulate fluid flow with Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics (SPH). Although commonly experiencing pressure fluctuations, schemes allowing for small changes in fluid density, referred to as weakly compressible (WCSPH and $\delta$-SPH), are often used because of their faster computational time when compared to implicit incompressible schemes (IISPH). Explicit numerical schemes for incompressible fluid flow (EISPH), although more computationally efficient than IISPH, have not been largely used in the literature. To explore advantages and disadvantages of EISPH, this study compared an EISPH scheme with WCSPH and $\delta$-SPH. The three schemes were compared for the case of still water and a wave generated by a dam-break. EISPH and $\delta$-SPH were also compared for the case of a dam-break wave colliding with a vertical wall and a dam-break wave flowing over a wet bed. The three schemes performed similarly in reproducing theoretical and experimental results. EISPH led to results overall similar to WCSPH and $\delta$-SPH, but with smoother pressure dynamics and faster computational times. EISPH presented some errors in the imposition of incompressibility, with the divergence of velocity being different from zero in parts of the fluid flow, especially near the surface. These errors in the divergence of velocity were comparable to the values of velocity divergence obtained with $\delta$-SPH. In an attempt to reduce the velocity divergence in EISPH, an iterative procedure was implemented to calculate the pressure (iterative-EISPH). Although no real improvement was achieved in terms of velocity divergence, the pressure thus calculated was smoother and in some cases was closer to measured experimental values.},

 abstract = {Boussinesq‐type equations can be used to model the nonlinear transformation of surface waves in shallow water due to the effects of shoaling, refraction, diffraction, and reflection. Different linear dispersion relations can be obtained by expressing the equations in different velocity variables. In this paper, a new form of the Boussinesq equations is derived using the velocity at an arbitrary distance from the still water level as the velocity variable instead of the commonly used depth‐averaged velocity. This significantly improves the linear dispersion properties of the Boussinesq equations, making them applicable to a wider range of water depths. A finite difference method is used to solve the equations. Numerical and experimental results are compared for the propagation of regular and irregular waves on a constant slope beach. The results demonstrate that the new form of the equations can reasonably simulate several nonlinear effects that occur in the shoaling of surface waves from deep to shallow water including the amplification of the forced lower‐ and higher‐frequency wave harmonics and the associated increase in the horizontal and vertical asymmetry of the waves.},

 abstract = {Large-scale tsunami propagation simulations from the fault region to the coast are conducted using a three-dimensional (3-D) parallel unstructured mesh finite element code (Fluidity-ICOM). Unlike conventional 2-D approximation models, our tsunami model solves the full 3-D incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. The model is tested against analytical solutions to simple dispersive wave propagation problems. Comparisons of our 3-D NS model results with those from linear shallow water and linear dispersive wave models demonstrate that the 3-D NS model simulates the dispersion of very short wavelength components more accurately than the 2-D models. This improved accuracy is achieved using only a small number (three to five) of vertical layers in the mesh. The numerical error in the wave velocity compared with the linear wave theory is less than 3% up to kH = 40, where k is the wave number and H is the sea depth. The same 2-D and 3-D models are also used to simulate two earthquake-generated tsunamis off the coast of Japan: the 2004 off Kii peninsula and the 2011 off Tohoku tsunamis. The linear dispersive and NS models showed good agreement in the leading waves but differed especially in their near-source, short wavelength dispersive wave components. This is consistent with the results from earlier tests, suggesting that the 3-D NS simulations are more accurate. The computational performance on a parallel computer showed good scalability up to 512 cores. By using a combination of unstructured meshes and high-performance computers, highly accurate 3-D tsunami simulations can be conducted in a practical timescale. Key Points describe a highly accurate 3-D model of near-field tsunami propagation. We demonstrate advantages of the present 3-D model over conventional 2-D models. We apply the model to the 2011 Tohoku tsunami and compare with observations. ?2013. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

As a first step, by restricting 2D problems, we propose a motion calculation method for the floating body based on 2D vortex method using fluid velocity and vorticity as unknown variables. Appling this method to motion calculation of a rectangular floating body, we confirmed its effectiveness through comparison between experimented and calculated results.It is important to promote the use of ocean renewable energy because there is a possibility of not only creating a new energy source but also leading to stable power supply in regions such as remote island areas. As one of ocean renewable energies, wind energy is given. Offshore wind energy generation facilities have less restriction in location and can supply more stable wind energy than on-land facilities. Offshore wind power generation facilities are classified into a bottom mounted type and a floating one. Adoption of the latter is expected in Japan because there are few areas with shallow waters (MLIT, 2014, 2016, 2017).As calculation methods for the viscous fluid proposed previously, mesh method, particle method and vortex method etc. are given.

A closed set of three equations was derived from the Navier–Stokes equation with no adjustable free parameters. The Kolmogorov constant and the skewness of the longitudinal velocity derivative were evaluated to be 1.779 and $-0.49$ , respectively, using the proposed model. The bottleneck effect was also reproduced in the near-dissipation range.},

 abstract = {Most of the coastal hydraulic studies in physical and numerical wave flumes (NWF) require the correct generation of nonlinear, long period waves at intermediate and shallow water conditions. In this paper, the ability to generate such long waves in an NWF based on the particle finite element method (PFEM) is analysed. Wavemaker theories based on the Stokes second-order wave theory, cnoidal wave theory and solitary wave theory are implemented in the NWF through piston type paddle boundary conditions. An assessment of the capability and robustness of generation and propagation of long waves in the NWF is carried out. Numerical results are compared to theoretical results and the data from physical tests. Results indicate that regular long waves of permanent form can be generated in an NWF based on the PFEM using the implemented wavemaker theories. However, when choosing a wavemaker theory a compromise has to be made between the target wave conditions and the validity range of each wavemaker theory.},

 abstract = {We present a general formulation for the analysis of fluid-structure interaction problems using the particle finite element method (PFEM). The key feature of the PFEM is the use of a Lagrangian description to model the motion of nodes (particles) in both the fluid and the structure domains. Nodes are thus viewed as particles which can freely move and even separate from the main analysis domain representing, for instance, the effect of water drops. A mesh connects the nodes defining the discretized domain where the governing equations, expressed in an integral form, are solved as in the standard FEM. The necessary stabilization for dealing with the incompressibility condition in the fluid is introduced via the finite calculus (FIC) method. A fractional step scheme for the transient coupled fluid-structure solution is described. Examples of application of the PFEM method to solve a number of fluid-structure interaction problems involving large motions of the free surface and splashing of waves are presented.},

 abstract = {There are great difficulties in properly evaluating the power present in waves in the Caribbean Sea due to of the scarcity of marine instrumentation and the reduced length of the existing records. This research aimed to design a new methodology for estimating wave power potential in places lacking instrumentation by using reanalysis wind and wave generation models to generate hourly synthetic wave information (maps and wave series), which was later compared and corrected with nearby buoy measurements. Nested runs of the models allowed the results to be downscaled and detailed wave power maps to be created. The best sites for a possible wave farm could then be identified. These maps were built from the propagation of characteristic sea-states of the synthetic series, and were chosen using joint probability, power percentiles and the k-means clustering algorithms. New series were generated in the chosen locations and processed to determine the wave power potential in different time scales. Isla Fuerte, a small non grid-connected island in the Colombian Caribbean, served as a case study for the implementation of the methodology.},

Vortex elements were introduced and vorticity redistributions were made over the solid surface in this scheme. Thickness of vorticity layer and panel size were figured out with a non dimensional thickness of vorticity layer defined by using kinematic viscosity coefficient and friction velocity based on the wall shear stress. To invdstigate effectiveness of this scheme, flows around a two-dimensional circular cylinder in a uniform flow were simulated through changing the non-dimensional thickness of vorticity layer and the initial calculation conditions. The simulations show that this scheme is effective: in spite of the initial conditions the calculation parameters could be automatically determined by using the non-dimensional thickness of vorticity layer, and the calculated results of the flow characteristics had good agreements with the other calculated results.},

The prebreaking shoaling shows very different characteristics on gentle slopes (1:20 and less) and on steeper slopes. A diagram constructed on the basis of a large number of numerical experiments gives a simple limit between which waves break on which slopes and which not. Typical examples of the range of wave behavior are shown. Waves that do not break at run up often break during run down. The velocity fields for the two types of breaking are compared and found to be very different. A simple explanation for this is offered.},

 abstract = {The effectiveness of cryosurgery, treatment of tumors by freezing, is highly dependent on knowledge of transient freezing extent, and therefore relies heavily on real-time imaging techniques for monitoring. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) holds much promise for this application. In cryosurgery there is a three order of magnitude change in impedance across the freezing boundary and there is a priori knowledge of the freezing origin. Furthermore, an EIT image of the tissue can be done prior to the cryosurgery. In this study, we have developed an EIT front tracking reconstruction algorithm which takes advantage of these particular attributes of cryosurgery. The method tracks the freezing interface rather than the impedance distribution in the freezing tissue. In addition to drastically reducing the number of parameters needed to define the image, the computational complexity is further reduced by using the more appropriate boundary element method (BEM) for solution to the forward problem. The front-tracking method was found to converge rapidly and accurately to a variety of simulated phantom images. {\textcopyright} 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

 abstract = {Modelling floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) is challenging due to the strong coupling between the aerodynamics of the turbine and the hydrodynamics of the floating platform. Physical testing at scale is faced with the additional challenge of the scaling mismatch between Froude number and Reynolds number due to working in the two fluid domains, air and water. In the drive for cost-reduction of floating wind energy, designers may be seeking to move towards high-fidelity numerical modelling as a substitute for physical testing. However, the numerical engineering tools typically used for FOWT modelling are considered as mid-fidelity to low-fidelity tools, and currently lack the level of accuracy required to do so. Furthermore, there is a lack of operational FOWT data available for further development and validation. High-fidelity tools, such as CFD, have greater accuracy but are cumbersome tools and still require validation. Physical scale model testing therefore continues to play an essential role in the development of FOWTs both as a source of validation data for numerical models and as an important development step along the path to commercialization of all platform concepts. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of both numerical modelling and physical FOWT scale model testing approaches and to provide guidance on the selection of the most appropriate approach (or combination of approaches). The current state-of-the-art will be discussed along with current research trends and areas for further investigation.},

The results have shown that waves due to typhoons of paths 2, 3 and 4 can be reasonably simulated on east coastal waters. However, discrepancies increase for the simulated results on west coastal waters because the island's central mountains partly damage the cyclonic structures of the passing-over typhoons. It is also found that the included nested grid scheme in SWAN could improve the accuracy of simulations in coastal waters to facilitate further engineering practices.},

 abstract = {The fundamental part of the contact stress problem solution using a finite element method is to locate possible contact areas reliably and efficiently. In this research, a remeshing technique is introduced to determine the contact region in a given accuracy. In the proposed iterative method, the meshes near the contact surface are modified so that the edge of the contact region is also an element's edge. This approach overcomes the problem of surface representation at the transition point from contact to non-contact region. The remeshing technique is efficiently employed to adapt the mesh for more precise representation of the contact region. The method is applied to both finite element and boundary element methods. Overlapping of the meshes in the contact region is prevented by the inclusion of displacement and force constraints using the Lagrange multipliers technique. Since the method modifies the mesh only on the contacting and neighbouring region, the solution to the matrix system is very close to the previous one in each iteration. Both direct and iterative solver performances on BEM and FEM analyses are also investigated for the proposed incremental technique. The biconjugate gradient method and LU with Cholesky decomposition are used for solving the equation systems. Two numerical examples whose analytical solutions exist are used to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method. They show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to the solutions with fixed meshes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Inhomogeneous nonlinear shallow-water equations are studied using the Carrier–Greenspan approach and the resulting equations are solved analytically. The Carrier–Greenspan transformations are commonly used hodograph transformations that transform the nonlinear shallow-water equations into a set of linear equations in which partial derivatives with respect to two auxiliary variables appear. Yet, when the resulting initial-value problem is treated analytically through the use of Green's functions, the partial derivatives of the Green's functions have non-integrable singularities. This has forced researchers to numerically differentiate the convolutions of the Green's functions. In this work we remedy this problem by differentiating the initial condition rather than the Green's function itself; we also perform a change of variables that renders the entire problem more easily treatable. This particular Green's function approach is especially useful to treat sources that are extended in time; we therefore apply it to model the run-down and run-up of the tsunami waves triggered by submarine landslides. Another advantage of the method presented is that the parametrization of the landslide using sources is done within the integral algorithm that is used for the rest of the problem instead of treating the landslide-generated wave as a separate incident wave. The method proves to be more accurate than the techniques based on Bessel function expansions if the sources are very localized.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we develop computationally efficient techniques to calculate statistics used in wind farm optimization with the goal of enabling the use of higher-fidelity models and larger wind farm optimization problems. We apply these techniques to maximize the annual energy production (AEP) of a wind farm by optimizing the position of the individual wind turbines. The AEP (a statistic) is the expected power produced by the wind farm over a period of 1 year subject to uncertainties in the wind conditions (wind direction and wind speed) that are described with empirically determined probability distributions. To compute the AEP of the wind farm, we use a wake model to simulate the power at different input conditions composed of wind direction and wind speed pairs. We use polynomial chaos (PC), an uncertainty quantification method, to construct a polynomial approximation of the power over the entire stochastic space and to efficiently (using as few simulations as possible) compute the expected power (AEP). We explore both regression and quadrature approaches to compute the PC coefficients. PC based on regression is significantly more efficient than the rectangle rule (the method most commonly used to compute the expected power). With PC based on regression, we have reduced on average by a factor of 5 the number of simulations required to accurately compute the AEP when compared to the rectangle rule for the different wind farm layouts considered. In the wind farm layout optimization problem, each optimization step requires an AEP computation. Thus, the ability to compute the AEP accurately with fewer simulations is beneficial as it reduces the cost to perform an optimization, which enables the use of more computationally expensive higher-fidelity models or the consideration of larger or multiple wind farm optimization problems. We perform a large suite of gradient-based optimizations to compare the optimal layouts obtained when computing the AEP with polynomial chaos based on regression and the rectangle rule. We consider three different starting layouts (Grid, Amalia, Random) and find that the optimization has many local optima and is sensitive to the starting layout of the turbines. We observe that starting from a good layout (Grid, Amalia) will, in general, find better optima than starting from a bad layout (Random) independent of the method used to compute the AEP. For both PC based on regression and the rectangle rule, we consider both a coarse (∼ 225) and a fine (∼ 625) number of simulations to compute the AEP. We find that for roughly one-third of the computational cost, the optimizations with the coarse PC based on regression result in optimized layouts that produce comparable AEP to the optimized layouts found with the fine rectangle rule. Furthermore, for the same computational cost, for the different cases considered, polynomial chaos finds optimal layouts with 0.4 % higher AEP on average than those found with the rectangle rule.},

 abstract = {A numerical model based on a boundary-element method is developed to predict the performance of flapping foils for the general cases where vorticities are shed near the leading edge as well as from the trailing edge. The shed vorticities are modelled as desingularized thin shear layers which propagate with the local flow velocity. Special treatments are developed to model the unsteady and alternating leading-edge separation (LES), which is a main element of difficulty for theoretical and numerical analyses of general flapping foils. The present method is compared with existing experiments where it is shown that the inclusion of LES significantly improves the prediction of thrust and efficiency, obtaining excellent agreement with measurements over a broad range of flapping frequencies (Strouhal number) and motion amplitudes (maximum angle of attack). It is found that the neglect of LES leads to substantial over-prediction of the thrust (and efficiency). The effects of LES on thrust generation in terms of the circulation around the foil, the steady and unsteady thrust components, and the vortex-induced pressure on the foil are elucidated. The efficiency and robustness of the method render it suitable for design optimization which generally requires large numbers of performance evaluations. To illustrate this, we present a sample problem of designing the flapping motion, with the inclusion of higher harmonic components, to maximize the efficiency under specified thrust. When optimal higher harmonic motions are included, the performance of the flapping foil is appreciably improved, mitigating the adverse effects of LES vortex on the performance.},

This paper gives an overview of wave resource modeling techniques and applies a methodology to esti-mate the naturally available and technically recoverable resource in a given deployment site. The methodology was initially developed by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), which uses a modified Gamma spectrum to interpret sea state hindcast parameter data produced by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA's) Wave-watch III. This Gamma spectrum is dependent on the calibration of two variables relating to the spectral width parameter and spectral peakedness parameter. In this study, this methodology was revised by the authors to increase its accuracy in formulating wave length. The revised methodology shows how to assess a given geographic area's wave resource based on its wave power density and total annual wave energy flux.},

 abstract = {We present a novel numerical method to simulate crack growth in 3D, directly from the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) geometry of the component, without any mesh generation. The method is an isogeometric boundary element method (IGABEM) based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). NURBS basis functions are used for the domain and crack representation as well as to approximate the physical quantities involved in the simulations. A stable quadrature scheme for singular integration is proposed to enhance the robustness of the method in dealing with highly distorted elements. Convergence studies in the crack opening displacement is performed for a penny-shaped crack and an elliptical crack. Two approaches to extract stress intensity factors (SIFs): the contour M integral and the virtual crack closure integral are compared using dual integral equations. The results show remarkable accuracy in the computed SIFs, leading to smooth crack paths and reliable fatigue lives, without requiring the generation of any mesh from the CAD model of the component under consideration.},

Of particular interest is the distinctive wedge-shaped wave pattern that forms on the surface of the fluid. By reformulating the governing equations with a standard boundary-integral method, we derive a system of nonlinear algebraic equations that enforce a singular integro-differential equation at each midpoint on a two-dimensional mesh. Our contribution is to solve the system of equations with a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method together with a banded preconditioner that is carefully constructed with entries taken from the Jacobian of the linearised problem. Further, we are able to utilise graphics processing unit acceleration to significantly increase the grid refinement and decrease the run-time of our solutions in comparison to schemes that are presently employed in the literature. Our approach provides opportunities to explore the nonlinear features of three-dimensional ship wave patterns, such as the shape of steep waves close to their limiting configuration, in a manner that has been possible in the two-dimensional analogue for some time. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {Triangular B-splines lend themselves naturally to problems such as blending and the filling of polygonal holes. Here we present an automatic method for smoothly blending piecewise polynomial surfaces using triangular B-splines. The method proceeds in two phases. In the first phase, the domain of the region to be blended or filled is triangulated and populated with basis functions. In the second phase, coefficients for these basis functions are found by minimizing a functional that measures the curvature of the blending or filling surface. Examples are provided that show the use of this method for a number of blending and filling problems.},

 abstract = {The concept of merging pre-processed textile materials with tailored mechanical properties into soft matrices is so far rarely used in the field of soft robotics. The herein presented work takes the advantages of textile materials in elastomer matrices to another level by integrating a material with highly anisotropic bending properties. A pre-fabricated textile material consisting of oriented carbon fibers is used as a stiff component to precisely control the mechanical behavior of the robotic setup. The presented robotic concept uses a multi-layer stack for the robot's body and dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) on both outer sides of it. The bending motion of the whole structure results from the combination of its mechanically adjusted properties and the force generation of the DEAs. We present an antagonistic switching setup for the DEAs that leads to deflections to both sides of the robot, following a biomimetic principle. To investigate the bending behavior of the robot, we show a simulation model utilizing electromechanical coupling to estimate the quasi-static deflection of the structure. Based on this model, a statement about the bending behavior of the structure in general is made, leading to an expected maximum deflection of 10 mm at the end of the fin for a static activation. Furthermore, we present an electromechanical network model to evaluate the frequency dependent behavior of the robot's movement, predicting a resonance frequency of 6.385 Hz for the dynamic switching case. Both models in combination lead to a prediction about the acting behavior of the robot. These theoretical predictions are underpinned by dynamic performance measurements in air for different switching frequencies of the DEAs, leading to a maximum deflection of 9.3 mm located at the end of the actuators. The herein presented work places special focus on the mechanical resonance frequency of the robotic setup with regard to maximum deflections.},

 abstract = {Expressions in closed form are derived for a number of local properties of a random, irrotational wave field. They are: (i) the mean potential and kinetic energies per unit projected area; (ii) the energy balance among the processes of energy input from the surface pressure fluctuations, rate of growth of potential and kinetic energy and horizontal energy flux; and (iii) the partition between potential and kinetic energy. These expressions are mainly in terms of quantities measured at the free surface, which are therefore functions of only two spatial variables (x, y) and of time t.\nApproximations for these expressions can be found simply by subsequent expansion methods; the fourth order being the highest for which the assumption of irrotational motion is appropriate in a real fluid. It is shown that the mean product of any three first-order quantities is of fourth or higher order in the root-mean-square wave slope, and this result is applied in estimating the magnitude of some higher order effects. In particular, the skewness of the surface displacement is of the order of the root-mean-square surface slope, which has been confirmed observationally by Kinsman (1960).\n(Published Online March 28 2006)\n(Received January 16 1961)},

@article{Phillips1974a,
 abstract = {A general theory is developed for studying changes of a wave train governed by non-linear partial differential equations. The technique is to average over the local oscillations in the medium and so obtain differential equations for the variations in amplitude, wave number, etc. It corresponds to the Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging technique for the ordinary differential equations of non-linear vibrations. The equations obtained in this way are hyperbolic and can be handled by the usual theory of quasi-linear hyperbolic systems, involving the theory of characteristics and shock waves. In this case the 'shocks' are abrupt changes in the amplitude, wave number, etc. They do not involve dissipation, but it turns out that frequency plays the role corresponding to entropy in ordinary gas dynamic shocks. It is not clear whether these shocks will really occur in practice. However, they have a number of interesting properties and seem to be relevant to the discussion of so-called collisionless shocks in plasma dynamics. The main applications envisaged are to water waves and plasma dynamics, and the theory is developed using typical equations from these areas. If the original equations are linear, this theory predicts the usual description of dispersive waves in terms of group velocity, so it may be considered as an extension of the group velocity concept to non-linear problems. Mathematically, the theory may be considered as an extension of some of the methods and ideas for the non-linear ordinary differential equations of vibration theory to partial differential equations.},

@article{Phillips2017,
 abstract = {This paper is concerned with the non-linear interactions between pairs of inter- secting gravity wave trains of arbitrary wavelength and direction on the surface of water whose depth is large compared with any of the wavelengths involved. An equation is set up to describe the time history of the Fourier components of the surface displacement in which are retained terms whose magnitude is of order (slope)2 relative to the linear (first-order) terms. The second-order terms give rise to Fourier components with wave-numbers and frequencies formed by the sums and differences of those of the primary components, and the amplitudes of these secondary components is always bounded in time and small in magnitude. The phase velocity of the secondary components is always different from the phase velocity of a free infinitesimal wave of the same wave-number. However, the third-order terms can give rise to tertiary components whose phase velocity is equal to the phase velocity of a free infinitesimal wave of the same wave-number, and when this condition is satisfied the amplitude of the tertiary component grows linearly with time in a resonant manner, and there is a continuing flux of potential energy from one wave-number to another. The time scale of the growth of the tertiary component is of order of the ( - 2)-power of the geometric mean of the primary wave slopes times the period of the tertiary wave. The Stokes per- manent wave appears as a special case, in which the tertiary wave-number is the same as that of the primary, but its phase is advanced by +IT. The energy transfer to the tertiary component in this case is usually interpreted as an increase in the phase velocity of the wave. The dynamical interactions in water of finite depth are considered briefly, and it is shown that the amplitude of the secondary components becomes large (though bounded in time) as the water depth becomes smaller than the wave- length of the longest primary wave.},

 abstract = {Fluid simulations are notoriously difficult to predict and control. As a result, authoring fluid flows often involves a tedious trial and error process. There is to date no convenient way of editing a fluid after it has been simulated. In particular, the Eulerian approach to fluid simulation is not suitable for flow editing since it does not provide a convenient spatio-temporal parameterization of the simulated flows. In this research, we develop a new technique to learn such parameterization. This technique is based on a new representation, the Advected Radial Basis Function. It is a time-varying kernel that models the local properties of the fluid. We describe this representation and demonstrate its use for interactive three-dimensional flow editing.},

This framework has been built considering the interests of wind farm developers in order to aid in the planning of future offshore wind farms using the UK Round 3 wind farms as a point of reference to calibrate the model. The present work applies the developed evaluation tool to estimate the cost, energy production, and the levelized cost of energy for the existing as-built layout at Middelgrunden wind farm; comparing these against the cost and energy production reported by the wind farm operator. From here, new layouts have then been designed using either a genetic algorithm or a particle swarm optimizer. This study has found that both optimization algorithms are capable of identifying layouts with reduced levelized cost of energy compared to the existing layout while still considering the specific conditions and constraints at this site and those typical of future projects. Reductions in levelized cost of energy such as this can result in significant savings over the lifetime of the project thereby highlighting the need for including new advanced methods to wind farm layout design.},

 abstract = {We study the force production dynamics of undulating elastic plates as a model for fish-like inertial swimmers. Using a beam model coupled with Lighthill's large-amplitude elongated-body theory, we explore different localised actuations at one extremity of the plate (heaving, pitching and a combination of both) in order to quantify the reactive and resistive contributions to the thrust. The latter has the form of a quadratic drag in large Reynolds number swimmers and has recently been pointed out as a crucial element in the thrust force balance. We validate the output of a weakly nonlinear solution to the fluid–structure model using thrust force measurements from an experiment with flexible plates subjected to the three different actuation types. The model is subsequently used in a self-propelled configuration – with a skin friction model that balances thrust to produce a constant cruising speed – to map the reactive versus resistive thrust production in a parameter space defined by the aspect ratio and the actuation frequency. We show that this balance is modified as the frequency of excitation changes and the response of the elastic plate shifts between different resonant modes, the pure heaving case being the most sensitive to the modal response with drastic changes in the reactive/resistive contribution ratio along the frequency axis. We analyse also the role of the phase lag between the heaving and pitching components in the case of combined actuation, showing in particular a non-trivial effect on the propulsive efficiency.},

 abstract = {The best known analytical model of swimming was originally developed by Lighthill and is known as the large amplitude elongated body theory (LAEBT). Recently, this theory has been improved and adapted to robotics through a series of studies ranging from hydrodynamic modeling to mobile multibody system dynamics. This article marks a further step towards the Lighthill theory. The LAEBT is applied to one of the best bio-inspired swimming robots yet built: the AmphiBot III, a modular anguilliform swimming robot. To that end, we apply a Newton-Euler modeling approach and focus our attention on the model of hydrodynamic forces. This model is numerically integrated in real time by using an extension of the Newton-Euler recursive forward dynamics algorithm for manipulators to a robot without a fixed base. Simulations and experiments are compared on undulatory gaits and turning maneuvers for a wide range of parameters. The discrepancies between modeling and reality do not exceed 16% for the swimming speed, while requiring only the one-time calibration of a few hydrodynamic parameters. Since the model can be numerically integrated in real time, it has significantly superior accuracy compared with computational speed ratio, and is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the most accurate models that can be used in real-time. It should provide an interesting tool for the design and control of swimming robots. The approach is presented in a self contained manner, with the concern to help the reader not familiar with fluid dynamics to get insight both into the physics of swimming and the mathematical tools that can help its modeling.},

 abstract = {The dislocation theory representation of faulting of Vvedenskaya, Steketee, Chin- nery, and Maruyama is used to compute the residual displacement, strain, and tilt fields at intermediate and large distances from major earthquakes. It is shown that the distant fields are large enough to be detected by modern instruments. The vertical displacement field from the Alaskan earthquake of March 27, 1964, indicates that the primary fault extended to a depth of 150 to 200 km and that it probably came to within 15 km of the surface. The residual strain observed at Hawaii amounted to 10 -s, a value which is reasonably consistent with the extent of faulting and the displacements near the source. The elastic strain energy release was about 10 m ergs. Other observations of residual strains and tilts are examined. In some cases nonfault- ing sources are probably involved. In other cases the observations may be a spurious mani- festation of instrumental hysteresis. The Mindlin-Cheng catalog of fields from various nuclei of strain in a half-space offers a convenient way to derive residual displacements from diverse sources, including those of Chinnery and Maruyama.},

These include the exact treatment of advection, the absence of intrinsic dissipation, exact conservation and more subtle properties that arise from its Hamiltonian formulation such as the existence of a minimum energy state for the particles. The implications of each of these are discussed, showing how they can be both advantages and disadvantages.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an overview and introduction to smoothed particle hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics in theory and in practice. Firstly, we give a basic grounding in the fundamentals of SPH, showing how the equations of motion and energy can be self-consistently derived from the density estimate. We then show how to interpret these equations using the basic SPH interpolation formulae and highlight the subtle difference in approach between SPH and other particle methods. In doing so, we also critique several 'urban myths' regarding SPH, in particular the idea that one can simply increase the 'neighbour number' more slowly than the total number of particles in order to obtain convergence. We also discuss the origin of numerical instabilities such as the pairing and tensile instabilities. Finally, we give practical advice on how to resolve three of the main issues with SPMHD: removing the tensile instability, formulating dissipative terms for MHD shocks and enforcing the divergence constraint on the particles, and we give the current status of developments in this area. Accompanying the paper is the first public release of the ndspmhd SPH code, a 1, 2 and 3 dimensional code designed as a testbed for SPH/SPMHD algorithms that can be used to test many of the ideas and used to run all of the numerical examples contained in the paper. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc..},

In the BEM, a system of differential equations is transformed into integral equations. This makes it possible to limit discretization to the border of the solution. Numerical discretization of the computational domain was performed with linear boundary elements, for which a constant value of unknown functions was assumed. The verification was carried out for the case of flow in a square cavity with one moving wall. The results obtained show that the use of approximations by simple linear functions is relatively easy for different shapes of the area, but the result may be affected by significant errors.},

By using a desingularization strategy to directly compute singular kernels in the strong-form collocation discretization, the SBM formulations are derived for the Dirichlet and Neumann problems. A fast multipole method (FMM) is then introduced to expedite the solution process. The CPU time and the memory requirement of the FMM-SBM scheme are both reduced to O(N), where N is the number of boundary nodes. Numerical examples with up to one million unknowns have been tested on a desktop computer. The results clearly illustrate that the proposed strategy appears very efficient and promising in solving large-scale Helmholtz problems.},

@article{R.1980,
 abstract = {This book is based on the author's experience with calculations involving polynomial splines. It presents those parts of the theory which are especially useful in calculations and stresses the representation of splines as linear combinations of B-splines. After two chapters summarizing polynomial approximation, a rigorous discussion of elementary spline theory is given involving linear, cubic and parabolic splines. The computational handling of piecewise polynomial functions (of one variable) of arbitrary order is the subject of chapters VII and VIII, while chapters IX, X, and XI are devoted to B-splines. The distances from splines with fixed and with variable knots is discussed in chapter XII. The remaining five chapters concern specific approximation methods, interpolation, smoothing and least-squares approximation, the solution of an ordinary differential equation by collocation, curve fitting, and surface fitting. The present text version differs from the original in several respects. The book is now typeset (in plain TeX), the Fortran programs now make use of Fortran 77 features. The figures have been redrawn with the aid of Matlab, various errors have been corrected, and many more formal statements have been provided with proofs. Further, all formal statements and equations have been numbered by the same numbering system, to make it easier to find any particular item. A major change has occured in Chapters IX-XI where the B-spline theory is now developed directly from the recurrence relations without recourse to divided differences. This has brought in knot insertion as a powerful tool for providing simple proofs concerning the shape-preserving properties of the B-spline series.},

 abstract = {The real impact of sea level rise (SLR) on coastal and ocean engineering infrastructures is anticipated to be significant. The associated huge costs of coastal flooding and lasting socio-economic crisis would require planners, decision-makers and engineers to use effectively all available knowledge and data to optimize flood defense protection systems. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian approach that integrates knowledge from previous performance history of structures (data, models and analysis) with more recent information from the simulations performed using the latest data, methods and modeling technology. These two sets of knowledge and information on past and present status of system contain various uncertainties and errors introduced by different input sources and analysis methods. We employ the concept of global uncertainty to quantify the total uncertainty affecting the design, functionality and maintenance of coastal flood defense systems in order to reduce damages resulting from the SLR and other extreme water level changes (e.g., storm surges by hurricanes, increased precipitation and ice melting). Our objective in this paper is to show coastal engineers how to use the prior knowledge with the most current information to improve the safety of flood defense systems. We demonstrate the proposed method in an example for the failure analysis of the 17th Street Flood Wall in New Orleans, where we estimate uncertainties that affected the design of the I-wall. We provide a methodology that integrates the contribution of SLR with all other available prior information to determine uncertainty levels for failure analysis of the flood defenses. Various uncertainties are present in engineering practice, explicit or implicit, and quantification of these is essential to safety and efficacy of coastal flood protection systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {The solution of the Poisson's equation used by the incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (ISPH) methods for estimating the pressure field is expensive in CPU time. The CPU time, consumed by the inversion of the operator ∇(1/$\rho$∇) and the estimation of the right hand side of the Poisson's equation, increases with the number N of particles used in a purely Lagrangian framework. In this work, this default of ISPH methods is overcome by solving the Poisson's equation on a Cartesian grid. This SPH-mesh coupling is equivalent to the particle in cell method. In a first step, in order to analyze its efficiency, the optimized version of two ISPH methods (divergence free and density invariant) is compared with the standard weakly compressible SPH method through two benchmarks of incompressible bidimensional flows characterized by the Reynolds number Re, Lamb-Oseen vortex (10 ≤Re≤ 100) and lid-driven cavity flow (100 ≤Re≤ 1000). In a second step, the numerical results obtained by the three SPH methods are compared to laboratory experimental data of a dam break flow in order to show the performance of the SPH-mesh coupling in a practical and complex flow problem. As in the configuration of the experimental setup, the numerical results are obtained for a Reynolds number Re = 3.8 106.},

A theoretical model to calculate the natural frequencies is developed based on linearized potential flow theory and eigenfunction expansion. Two numerical methods are implemented: a boundary element method (BEM) and a Navier-Stokes solver (CFD). Both the BEM and CFD have linearized free-surface and body-boundary conditions. As expected, the BEM over-predicts the moonpool response significantly, in particular at the first sloshing mode. The CFD is in general able to predict the maximum moonpool response adequately, both at the piston and first sloshing modes. Both numerical methods fail to predict the Duffing-type behaviour at the first sloshing mode, due to the linearized free-surface conditions. The Duffing behaviour is more pronounced for the largest recess. The main source of damping in the proximity of the first sloshing mode is discussed.},

 abstract = {Experiments were performed on an oscillating foil to assess its performance in producing large forces for propulsion and effective maneuvering. First, experiments on a harmonically heaving and pitching foil were performed to determine its propulsive efficiency under conditions of significant thrust production, as function of the principal parameters: the heave amplitude, Strouhal number, angle of attack, and phase angle between heave and pitch. Planform area thrust coefficients of 2.4 were recorded for 35° maximum angle of attack and efficiencies of up to 71.5% were recorded for 15° maximum angle of attack. A plateau of good efficiency, in the range of 50-60%, is noted. A phase angle of 90-100° between pitch and heave is found to produce the best thrust performance. Also, the introduction of higher harmonies in the heave motion, so as to ensure a sinusoidal variation in the angle of attack produced much higher thrust coefficient at high Strouhal numbers. Second, experiments on a harmonically oscillating foil with a superposed pitch bias, as well as experiments on impulsively moving foils in still water, were conducted to assess the capability of the foil to produce large lateral forces for maneuvering. Mean side force coefficients of up to 5.5, and instantaneous lift coefficients of up to 15 were recorded, demonstrating an outstanding capability for maneuvering force production. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

 abstract = {Assessments of global wave power have been receiving increasing attention currently; however, a characterization of the global resources that holistically consider the different temporal scales that influence wave climate (monthly and seasonal, interannual and long-term) is still lacking. Moreover, the debate around the global figure of available resource is still widely open. This study provides a new global wave power assessment using a dataset that covers the period from 1948 to 2008, which was corrected using altimetry data and validated with buoys in terms of wave power. This study characterizes the mean wave power globally as well as its monthly and seasonal variability. Furthermore, it provides a link with the most relevant climate indices globally. The effect of the interannual variability is especially noteworthy for the Northern Hemisphere, where the seasonality is strongest. Additionally, we detect decadal long-term changes and determine that natural variability could explain a few of the differences found between decades. Lastly, we provide an assessment of the global theoretical wave power that covers the last six decades, compare approaches and estimates, and discuss factors of discrepancy. The global offshore wave power is estimated at 32,000. TW. h/yr, which is reduced to 16,000. TW. h/yr when considering the direction of the energy. The historical average change is 580. TW. h/decade. Our results indicate that the global natural variability could be a more relevant factor in the lifetime of wave farms than the historical long-term changes in wave energy.},

Power series are calculated for six types of wave energy converters (WECs), four that operate in deep water, and two in shallow water. Forecasts are run using a physics-based model and statistical models. Five major conclusions emerge from the analysis. First, given the intermittency of buoy data, physics model hindcasts are an effective method of interpolating missing values. Second, the power output from converters does not have the same properties as the wave energy flux. Instead, the power output is a nonlinear function of the wave height and period, with fewer large outliers. Third, time series models predict well over near-term horizons while physics models forecast more accurately over longer horizons. The convergence point, at which the two types of models achieve comparable degrees of accuracy, is in the area of 2–3 h in these data sets, lower than in most prior studies. The recommendation is to use time series methods to forecast at the horizons required for reserves, and physics models for long-term planning. Fourth, the predictability of the power output can differ substantially for individual converters. Finally, wave energy is found to be significantly less costly in terms of reserves than wind and solar.},

The main aim is to predict and validate the response of the moored floating structure under the action of periodic waves. The Euler equations together with an artificial viscosity are used as the governing equations to describe the flow field. The motion of the moored floating body is described using the Newton's second law of motion. The interactions between the waves and structures are modeled by setting a series of SPH particles on the boundary of the structure. The hydrodynamic forces acting on the floating body are evaluated by summing up the interacting forces on the boundary particles from the neighboring fluid particles. The water surface elevations, the movements of the floating body and the moored forces are all calculated and compared with the available experimental data. Good agreements are obtained for the dynamic response and hydrodynamic performance of the floating body. The numerical results of different immersion depths of the floating body are compared with that of the corresponding fixed body. The effects of the relative length and the density of the structure on the performance of the floating body are analyzed.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the design and dynamic analysis of a multi-column tension leg platform floating offshore wind turbine (TLP FOWT) with broken tendons. The proposed concept is based on a conventional Tri-Floater platform configuration but is especially optimized for an intermediate water depth of 60 m. Tendons are simulated to be broken at a specific time of interest. The hydrodynamic parameters and motion responses of the TLP FOWT have been calculated using the hydrodynamic analysis software WAMIT and ANSYS/AQWA. These parameters are then used in the simulation of coupled responses of the FOWT by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's analysis suite of tool, FAST. The tendon failure has been investigated to examine the system performance under the accidental limit states (ALS) described in the design code DNV-RP-0286. A series of dynamic analysis under operational and extreme environmental conditions (with 12 different load cases) are carried out with the combination of wind and waves. The results demonstrate that the turbine is able to remain highly stable during the 3-h simulations conducted. The platform's response amplitude operators (RAOs) evaluated show good stability in heave and pitch. The tendon failures affected the FOWT's heave, pitch and roll motions, hence its natural frequencies, and the tension in the non-broken tendons. The average tensile force in the line adjacent to the broken line is found to be doubled, while the safety factors as specified in DNV-OS-E301 are remained within the recommended value. This paper provides further insights into the hydrodynamics of the multi-column TLP FOWT, with the aim to provide new information to the offshore wind research community.},

Application of a multiple-scale perturbation technique and matched asymptotic analysis leads to a uniform analytical solution of the depth-averaged governing equations in three dimensions. We show that the slow depth variation has a leading-order effect on the evolution of the normal mode amplitude and direction. This dynamics is much richer than the two-dimensional limit analysed in previous studies. For tsunamigenic disturbances, we show that the hydro-acoustic wave field is made up by longshore trapped and offshore propagating components, which were not explicated in previous work. For a plane beach, we find an exact analytical solution of the model equation in terms of integrals of Bessel functions. Our model offers a physical insight into the evolution of hydro-acoustic waves of interest for the design of tsunami early warning systems.},

 abstract = {In this work, the motion of a two-dimensional rectangular freely floating body under waves is simulated using Improved Meshless Local Petrov-Galerkin method with Rankine Source function (IMLPG_R) with variable spacing resolutions. The IMLPG_R method is a particle method that solves Navier–Stokes equations using the fractional step method to capture the wave properties. However, many existing particle methods are computationally intensive to model the wave-floating body due to the requirement of fine particles, needing uniform distribution throughout the domain. To improve the computational efficiency and capture the body response properly, variable spaced particle distribution with fine resolution near the floating body and coarse resolution far from the body is implemented. Numerical schemes to handle variable resolutions are reported. An iterative scheme to handle the wave-floating body is implemented in the particle method. Two test cases, one with small wave and another with steep waves, are simulated for uniform particle distribution and the result shows good agreement with literature. Based on this, the performance of the variable spaced particle distribution is tested in coupling with floating body solver. The application of the method for wave impact load from the green water loading of the floating structure is also simulated.},

The performance and the behaviour of the SWAN model are shown in two observed cases in which waves are regenerated by the wind after a considerable decrease due to shallow water effects. In the case of the Haringvliet (a closed branch of the Rhine estuary, the Netherlands) reasonable results in terms of significant wave heights were obtained. In the case of Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron, USA), the SWAN model underestimates the significant wave height deep inside the bay (as did two other models). Due to the absence of triad wave-wave interactions in the model the mean period is not properly shifted to the higher frequencies in shallow water. Adding these triads is planned for the next phase of developing the SWAN model.},

 abstract = {A third-generation spectral wave model (Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN)) for small-scale, coastal regions with shallow water, (barrier) islands, tidal flats, local wind, and ambient currents is verified in stationary mode with measurements in five real field cases. These verification cases represent an increasing complexity in two-dimensional bathymetry and added presence of currents. In the most complex of these cases, the waves propagate through a tidal gap between two barrier islands into a bathymetry of channels and shoals with tidal currents where the waves are regenerated by a local wind. The wave fields were highly variable with up to 3 orders of magnitude difference in energy scale in individual cases. The model accounts for shoaling, refraction, generation by wind, whitecapping, triad and quadruplet wave-wave interactions, and bottom and depth-induced wave breaking. The effect of alternative formulations of these processes is shown. In all cases a relatively large number of wave observations is available, including observations of wave directions. The average rms error in the computed significant wave height and mean wave period is 0.30 m and 0.7 s, respectively, which is 10% of the incident values for both. 1. Introduction The wave model Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) has been developed by the authors (described by Booij et al. [this issue]) to estimate wave conditions in small-scale, coastal re-gions with shallow water, (barrier) islands, tidal flats, local wind, and ambient currents. It is a third-generation, discrete spectral wave model that describes the evolution of the two-dimensional wave energy spectrum in arbitrary conditions of wind, currents, and bathymetry.

 abstract = {a b s t r a c t Renewable energy resource inventories show that ocean waves are one of the most energy dense un-tapped resources in the world, and present an opportunity to generate significant quantities of elec-tricity. To accurately assess the levels of usable energy over long periods, a parametric representation of the raw wave resource is required. This study investigates the variability across four wave energy assessment methods, and two input data sources, to quantify the uncertainties in WEC power production assessments. Two conventional methods were tested: a time-series method and a standard spectral method with a generic spectral shape. Two higher fidelity techniques were additionally studied; an aggregate spectral and a partitioned spectral method. Annual WEC energy production assessments varied between 472 MWh and 543 MWh, a difference of 15%. The partitioned spectral method is shown to minimize prediction uncertainties, yet results in a 14% reduction in annual WEC energy production and increasing power variability. Spectral shape has limited impact on power estimates and energy production assessments, while the numerical wave model data can underestimate annual energy estimates by up to 13%. These uncertainties significantly impact the feasibility of wave energy developments and need to be accounted for as the industry matures.},

Validation activities such as these lead to improvement of offshore wind modeling tools, which will enable the development of more innovative and cost-effective offshore wind designs. For Phase II of the project, numerical models of the DeepCwind floating semisubmersible wind system were validated using measurement data from a 1/50th-scale validation campaign performed at the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands offshore wave basin. Validation of the models was performed by comparing the calculated ultimate and fatigue loads for eight different wave-only and combined wind/wave test cases against the measured data, after calibration was performed using free-decay, wind-only, and wave-only tests. The results show a decent estimation of both the ultimate and fatigue loads for the simulated results, but with a fairly consistent underestimation in the tower and upwind mooring line loads that can be attributed to an underestimation of wave-excitation forces outside the linear wave-excitation region, and the presence of broadband frequency excitation in the experimental measurements from wind. Participant results showed varied agreement with the experimental measurements based on the modeling approach used. Modeling attributes that enabled better agreement included: the use of a dynamic mooring model; wave stretching, or some other hydrodynamic modeling approach that excites frequencies outside the linear wave region; nonlinear wave kinematics models; and unsteady aerodynamics models. Also, it was observed that a Morison-only hydrodynamic modeling approach could create excessive pitch excitation and resulting tower loads in some frequency bands.},

Previous investigations showed that the underprediction was primarily related to nonlinear hydrodynamic loading, so two new validation campaigns were performed to separately examine the different hydrodynamic load components. In this paper, we validate a variety of tools against this new test data, focusing on the ability to accurately model the low-frequency loads on a semisubmersible floater when held fixed under wave excitation and when forced to oscillate in the surge direction. However, it is observed that models providing better load predictions in these two scenarios do not necessarily produce a more accurate motion response in a moored configuration.},

 abstract = {The objective of OC6 Phase I is to investigate the persistent under-prediction (about 20% on average) of the structural loads in the OC5-DeepCwind floating semisubmersible wind system, as observed within the previous OC5 Phase II project [1]. The OC5 results indicate that much of this under-prediction originates from the low-frequency response of the system at the surge/pitch natural frequencies, resulting from nonlinear hydrodynamic loading and/or overprediction of hydrodynamic damping. This work package therefore focuses on better understanding this low-frequency response behavior, the applicability of computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) models and engineering-level hydrodynamic models for predicting the nonlinear hydrodynamic loading, and the level of uncertainty in the measured response characteristics. To address these objectives, two experimental campaigns were developed and performed in 2017 and 2018 by a sub-group of the OC5 project: Floating test campaign: A simplified OC5-DeepCwind semisubmersible model (no turbine, rigid tower) was moored to three taut-spring lines and subjected to motion decay and wave tests (regular and irregular waves), during which motion amplitudes of the model were measured (see Figure 1a).  The purpose of this test campaign was to examine the repeatability of the low-frequency response of the system to wave excitation and determine the level of uncertainty in the response behavior.Constrained test campaign: The same model, but without the tower present, was fixed to a carriage and subjected to towing, forced oscillation and wave tests (regular and irregular waves), during which forces exerted upon the model were measured (see Figure 1b). The purpose of this test campaign was to examine the hydrodynamic loading contributions by separating the wave excitation and radiation forces.},

 abstract = {The Naval Research Laboratory created a wave forecasting system in support of the Nearshore Canyon Experiment (NCEX) field program. The outer nest of this prediction system encompassed the Southern California Bight. This forecasting system is described in this paper, with analysis of results via comparison to the extensive buoy network in the region. There are a number of potential errors, two of which are poor resolution of islands in the Bight—which have a strong impact on nearshore wave climate—and the use of the stationary assumption for computations. These two problems have straightforward solutions, but the solutions are computationally expensive, so an operational user must carefully consider their cost. The authors study the impact of these two types of error (relative to other errors, such as error in boundary forcing) using several hindcasts performed after the completion of NCEX. It is found that, with buoy observations as ground truth, the stationary assumption leads to a modest increase in root-mean-square error; this is due to relatively poor prediction of the timing of swell arrivals and local sea growth/decay. The model results are found to be sensitive to the resolution of islands; however, coarse resolution does not incur an appreciable penalty in terms of error statistics computed via comparison to buoy observations, suggesting that other errors dominate. Inaccuracy in representation of the local atmospheric forcing likely has a significant impact on wave model error. Perhaps most importantly, the accuracy of directional distribution of wave energy at the open ocean boundaries appears to be a critical limitation on the accuracy of the model-data comparisons inside the Bight.

This chapter discusses thermoacoustic effects caused by heated surfaces, with particular emphasis on situations in which large amplitude acoustic oscillations are maintained. These are caused, as known, by configurations that are unstable. This chapter discusses oscillating flow over a nonisothermal surface.

Then, for every nearshore area, based on the bivariate distributions of the sea states occurrences and also on the power matrix of each device, the performances of each wave energy converter were estimated in terms of the expected electrical power. The results of the present work provide valuable information for the future wave farm projects, which could become in the near future a reliable and effective way to produce energy in island environments.},

We simulate an inviscid, irrotational, incompressible fluid bounded below by a flat wall, and above by an evolving free surface. The computations make use of spectral derivatives on the surface, but also require computing a velocity potential in the bulk, which we carry out using a finite element method with fourth-order elements that are curved to match the free surface. This computationally expensive step is solved using a parallel multigrid algorithm, which is discussed in detail.

 abstract = {Zakharov's (1968) Hamiltonian formulation of water waves is used to prove analytically Tanaka's (1983) numerical result that superharmonic disturbances to periodic waves of permanent form exchange stability when the wave energy is an extremum as a function of wave height. Tanaka's (1985) explanation for the non-appearance of superharmonic bifurcation is also derived, and the non-existence of stability exchange when the wave speed is an extremum is explained. 1. Introduction We consider the stability of finite-amplitude two-dimensional water waves of permanent form to two-dimensional disturbances of the same wavelength, which are called superharmonic. This problem WM considered first by Longuet-Higgins (19784, who showed that gravity waves are stable to such disturbances for h/h < 0.1337, which was the greatest height for which the calculations were accurate. Extrapolation of the results indicated an exchange of stability for h/h = 0.1388, which is the height for which the wave speed c first attains a stationary value (in this case a maximum) as a function of wave height. This is expected, since there is a disturbance stationary relative to the wave when c is an extremum. Here h denotes wave height defined as vertical distance between crests and troughs, and h is the wavelength (i.e. horizontal distance between neighbouring crests). An exchange of stability means that in a frame moving with the wave the eigenvalue giving the growth rate of infinitesimal disturbances goes through zero from pure imaginary to real and that the critical eigenvector describes a disturbance that is stationary relative to the propagating wave. However, Tanaka (1983) reexamined the superharmonic instability of gravity waves and found the surprising result that exchange of stability occurs for a wave},

 abstract = {Recording ocean-bottom pressures in offshore regions has increased our understanding of tsunami sources and promoted the development of rapid source estimation for early tsunami warning. Analytical solutions for the water height at the surface have often played an important role as a reference model in these efforts. To understand the system better and to develop the techniques further, not only the water height but the velocity in the sea and the pressure at the sea bottom are important. The present study obtains a solution for the velocity potential for sea-bottom deformation with an arbitrary source time function, and derives analytical solutions for the velocity distributions in the sea and the pressure at the bottom. These enable us to visualize the tsunami generation process, including the velocity field. The solutions can also give a theoretical background for setting the initial conditions of height and velocity in 2-D tsunami propagation simulations. Furthermore, the solution of the ocean-bottom pressure indicates that when the sea-bottom uplifts at an increasing rate, the sea-bottom pressure increases through a dynamic effect. This dynamic contribution will not be negligible as we develop more rapid and precise source estimation techniques using ocean-bottom pressure gauges within the source region.},

@article{Saitoh2013,
 abstract = {The standard formulation of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) assumes that the local density distribution is differentiable. This assumption is used to derive the spatial derivatives of other quantities. However, this assumption breaks down at the contact discontinuity. At the contact discontinuity, the density of the low-density side is overestimated while that of the high-density side is underestimated. As a result, the pressure of the low-density (high-density) side is overestimated (underestimated). Thus, unphysical repulsive force appears at the contact discontinuity, resulting in the effective surface tension. This tension suppresses fluid instabilities. In this paper, we present a new formulation of SPH, which does not require the differentiability of density. Instead of the mass density, we adopt the internal energy density (pressure) and its arbitrary function, which are smoothed quantities at the contact discontinuity, as the volume element used for the kernel integration. We call this new formulation density-independent SPH (DISPH). It handles the contact discontinuity without numerical problems. The results of standard tests such as the shock tube, Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, point-like explosion, and blob tests are all very favorable to DISPH. We conclude that DISPH solved most of the known difficulties of the standard SPH, without introducing additional numerical diffusion or breaking the exact force symmetry or energy conservation. Our new SPH includes the formulation proposed by Ritchie & Thomas as a special case. Our formulation can be extended to handle a non-ideal gas easily. {\textcopyright} 2013.

However, it cannot be applied to many industrial systems because of several critical problems such as modeling of large-scale simulations, complexly shaped wall boundaries and free surface fluid flow. To solve these problems, novel models were developed by our group. A coarse-grain DEM model was developed for large-scale simulations, a signed distance function-based wall boundary model was developed for complexly shaped walls and a DEM-moving particle semi-implicit method was developed for solid-liquid flow involving a free surface. The adequacy of these models was demonstrated through verification and validation tests. Our approach shows promise in industrial applications.},

@article{Sales-Mayor2004,
 abstract = {Experimental data as well as numerical simulations are very often affected by "noise", random fluctuations that distort the final output or the intermediate products of a numerical process. In this paper, a new method for smoothing data given on nonstructured grids is proposed. It takes advantage of the smoothing properties of kernel-weighted averaging and least-squares techniques. The weighted averaging is performed following a Shepard-like procedure, where Gaussian kernels are employed, while least-squares fitting is reduced to the use of very few basis functions so as to improve smoothness, though at the price of interpolation accuracy. Once we have defined an n-point grid and want to make a smoothed fit at a given grid point, this method reduces to consideration of all m-point stencils (for a given value of m where m < n) that include that point, and to make a least-squares fitting, for that particular point, in each of those stencils; finally, the various results, thus obtained, are weight-averaged, the weights being inversely proportional to the distance of the point to the middle of the stencil. Then this process is repeated for all the grid points so as to obtain the smoothing of the input function. Though this method is generalized for the multivariate case, one-, two-, and five-dimensional test cases are shown as examples of the performance of this method. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, when only traditional first-order control signals are applied to the wave generator errors will be introduced. Hence, a second-order signal has to be calculated and imposed in order to obtain satisfactory long wave conditions in the physical model. The necessary signal and transfer functions are outlined below for all common types of wave boards. It is demonstrated that dependent on the type (piston, hinged, etc.) considerable differences can be found in the amplitude of the required second-order control signal. Also the erroneous longwave energy is assessed in case of only first-order wave generation. The results indicate that in such situations significant deviations from the correct long waves may appear, but it turns out that these errors are to a certain extent independent of the actual type of wave board used for the wave generation. The typical range of the deviations is shown to be from − 100% to about + 300% if second-order (compensation) signals are not applied. {\textcopyright} 1985 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

 abstract = {The basic features of higher harmonic waves were originally presented by Stokes in 1847 who showed that a 2nd-order regular wave would attain a higher, sharper crest and a flatter trough than the basic linear one. In this paper, these characteristics are investigated for an irregular wave train. This was done to make it possible to reproduce in a laboratory flume a wave train which has the correct profile and rms according to 2nd-order theory. The 2nd-order wave heights and the overall horizontal asymmetries of the wave train were calculated for a 1st-order PM and a Jonswap spectrum. The theoretical predictions show that the traditional wave generation in a laboratory flume which is based on linear theory produces free 2nd-order waves in addition to the bound 2nd-order waves described by Stokes. These free, parasitic waves incorrectly distort the shape of the waves and produce a varying rms as a function of distance from the wave paddle. In the 2nd-order theory presented in this paper, these free (parasitic) waves are calculated for the entire spectrum. Knowing these, they can be eliminated by compensating for them by using a 2nd-order control signal on the wave paddle. This is verified by a series of model tests which show that realistic wave profiles can be generated only by means of 2nd-order control signals. The theory and corresponding paddle control are presented for any type of translating, rotating or combined wave generator. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

Knowledge of the temporal and spatial variations of wave energy is required for locating a wave power plant. This study investigates the variations in wave power at 19 locations covering the Indian shelf seas using the ERA-Interim dataset produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The ERA-Interim data is compared with the measured wave parameters in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Along the western shelf seas of India, the seasonal oscillations lead to variation of the wave power from the lowest seasonal mean value (2.6kW/m) in the post-monsoon period (October-January) to the highest value (25.9kW/m) in the south-west monsoon (June-September) period. Significant (10-20%) inter-annual variations are detected at few locations. The mean annual wave power along the eastern Indian shelf seas (2.6-9.9kW/m) is lower than the mean annual wave power along the western part (7.9-11.3kW/m). The total annual mean wave power available along the western shelf seas of India is around 19.5GW. Along the eastern shelf seas, it is around 8.7GW. In the Indian Shelf seas, the annual mean wave power is highest (11.3kW/m) at the southern location (location 11), and the seasonal variation in wave power is also less. Hence, location 11 is a better location for a wave power plant in the Indian shelf seas.},

 abstract = {This paper presents both linear and nonlinear analyses of extreme responses for a multi-body wave energy converter (WEC) in severe sea states. The WEC known as M4 consists of three cylindrical floats with diameters and draft which increase from bow to stern with the larger mid and stern floats having rounded bases so that the overall system has negligible drag effects. The bow and mid float are rigidly connected by a beam and the stern float is connected by a beam to a hinge above the mid float where the rotational relative motion would be damped to absorb power in operational conditions. A range of focussed wave groups representing extreme waves were tested on a scale model without hinge damping, also representing a more general system of interconnected cylindrical floats with multi-mode forcing. Importantly, the analysis reveals a predominantly linear response structure in hinge angle and weakly nonlinear response for the beam bending moment, while effects due to drift forces, expected to be predominantly second order, are not accounted for. There are also complex and violent free-surface effects on the model during the excitation period driven by the main wave group, which generally reduce the overall motion response. Once the main group has moved away, the decaying response in the free-vibration phase decays at a rate very close to that predicted by simple linear radiation damping. Two types of nonlinear harmonic motion are demonstrated. During the free-vibration phase, there are only double and triple frequency Stokes harmonics of the linear motion, captured using a frequency doubling and tripling model. In contrast, during the excitation phase, these harmonics show much more complex behaviour associated with nonlinear fluid loading. Although bound harmonics are visible in the system response, the overall response is remarkably linear until temporary submergence of the central float (‘dunking') occurs. This provides a strong stabilising effect for angular amplitudes greater than ${\sim}30^{\circ }$ and can be treated as a temporary loss of part of the driving wave as long as submergence continues. With an experimentally and numerically derived response amplitude operator (RAO), we perform a statistical analysis of extreme response for the hinge angle based on wave data at Orkney, well known for its severe wave climate, using the NORA10 wave hindcast. For storms with spectral peak wave periods longer than the RAO peak period, the response is controlled by the steepness of the sea state rather than the wave height. Thus, the system responds very similarly under the most extreme sea states, providing an upper bound for the most probable maximum response, which is reduced significantly in directionally spread waves. The methodology presented here is relevant to other single and multi-body systems including WECs. We also demonstrate a general and potentially important reciprocity result for linear body motion in random seas: the averaged wave history given an extreme system response and the average response history given an extreme wave match in time, with time reversed for one of the signals. This relationship will provide an efficient and robust way of defining a ‘designer wave', for both experimental testing and computationally intensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD), for a wide range of wave–structure interaction problems.},

We assessed the predictability of available global offshore wind and wave power for lead times of up to 9 days using a state-of-the-art wave model and a six-member multi-model ensemble of operational numerical weather predictions during the boreal summer and winter for the period 2008–2012. The results show that wave power is predictable over large areas of the global ocean with a prediction error of <20% at a lead time of 3 days. In the tropical ocean, wave power can be accurately predicted even 9 days in advance. The predictability of wind power was generally low compared to that of wave power. However, wind power can be predicted 5 days in advance with the lower ensemble spread in the Pacific trade wind zone.},

 abstract = {Many different concepts of marine renewable energy sources are currently being developed. Wide research efforts are focused on OWC (Oscillating Water Column) systems that are under study for onshore as well as for floating applications. In particular U-OWC systems, embodying a U-duct on the wave-beaten side, have raised large interest and found application in a harbour breakwater. In order to analyse the interaction between the waves and the U-OWC, in terms of reflection and transmission coefficients, as well as the overall performance of the system, a CFD simulation of a full-scale U-OWC breakwater has been carried out in order to simulate the flow field in front of breakwater and inside the OWC device, taking into account the characteristics of the air turbine adopted as power take-off device. In order to reduce the huge need of computational resources, CFD unsteady simulation have been carried out in a two dimensional (2D) reference frame by solving the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations while the water-air interaction is taken into account by means of the Volume Of Fluid (VOF) model. In order to overcome the problems related to the simulation of the air turbine in the 2D domain, the connection between the chamber and the external ambient is modelled as a porous zone where analytical equations able to model air duct and turbine are implemented. A further outcome of the present work is the calibration of the analytical model used for performance analysis and control system design.},

We show that $\gamma$-Progress naturally gives rise to an exploration policy that directs attention to complex but learnable dynamics in a balanced manner, as a result overcoming the "white noise problem". As a result, our $\gamma$-Progress-driven controller achieves significantly higher AWML performance than state-of-the-art baselines.},

 abstract = {This expository review is devoted to fish swimming and bird/insect flight. (i) The simple waving motion of an elongated flexible ribbon plate of constant width, immersed in a fluid at rest, propagating a wave distally down the plate to swim forward is first considered to provide a fundamental concept on energy conservation. It is generalized to include variations in body width and thickness, vortex shedding from appended dorsal, ventral and caudal fins to closely simulate fish swimming for which a nonlinear theory is presented for large-amplitude propulsion. (ii) For bird flight, the pioneering studies on oscillating rigid wings are briefed, followed by presenting a nonlinear unsteady theory for flexible wing with arbitrary variations in shape and trajectory with a comparative study with experiments. (iii) For insect flight, more recent advances are reviewed under aerodynamic theory and modeling, computational methods, and experiments, on forward and hovering flights with producing leading-edge vortex to give unsteady high lift. (iv) Prospects are explored on extracting intrinsic flow energy by fish and bird to gain thrust for propulsion. (v) The mechanical and biological principles are drawn together for unified studies on the energetics in deriving metabolic power for animal locomotion, leading to a surprising discovery that the hydrodynamic viscous drag on swimming fish is largely associated with laminar boundary layers, thus drawing valid and sound evidences for a resolution to the fish-swim paradox proclaimed by Gray (1936, 1968).},

@article{Seiffert2017,
 abstract = {This study investigates a wave-breaking onset criteria to be implemented in the non-linear potential flow solver HOS-NWT. The model is a computationally efficient, open source code, which solves for the free surface in a numerical wave tank using the High-Order Spectral (HOS) method. The goal of this study is to determine the best method to identify the onset of random single and multiple breaking waves over a large domain at the exact time they occur. To identify breaking waves, a breaking onset criteria based on the ratio of local energy flux velocity to the local crest velocity, introduced by Barthelemy et al. (2017) is selected. The breaking parameter is uniquely applied in the numerical model in that calculations of the breaking onset criteria ratio are not made only at the location of the wave crest, but at every point in the domain and at every time step. This allows the model to calculate the onset of a breaking wave the moment it happens, and without knowing anything about the wave a priori. The application of the breaking criteria at every point in the domain and at every time step requires the phase velocity to be calculated instantaneously everywhere in the domain and at every time step. This is achieved by calculating the instantaneous phase velocity using the Hilbert transform and dispersion relation. A comparison between more traditional crest-tracking techniques shows the calculation of phase velocity using Hilbert transform at the location of the breaking wave crest provides a good approximation of crest velocity. The ability of the selected wave breaking criteria to predict single and multiple breaking events in two dimensions is validated by a series of large-scale experiments. Breaking waves are generated by energy focusing and modulational instability methods, with a wide range of primary frequencies. Steep irregular waves which lead to breaking waves, and irregular waves with an energy focusing wave superimposed are also generated. This set of waves provides a wide range of breaking-wave strengths, types and scales for validation of the model. A comparison of calculations made using HOS-NWT with experimental measurements show that the model is successful at predicting the occurrence of wave breaking, as well as accurately calculating breaking onset time and location. Although the current study is limited to a unidirectional wave field, the success of the wave-breaking model presented provides the basis for application of the model in a multidirectional wave field. By including wave breaking onset with the addition of an appropriate energy dissipation model into HOS-NWT, we can increase the application range of the model, as well as decrease the occurrence of numerical instabilities that are associated with breaking waves in a potential flow solver. An accurate description of the wave field is useful for predicting the dynamic response of offshore vessels and marine renewable energy devices, predicting loads on marine structures and the general physics of ocean waves, for example.},

 abstract = {"Maximum allowable wave height" is proposed as a new criterion for assessing the performance of coastal facilities when planning a strategy for adapting these facilities to global climate change. Since it considers the prevention of wave overtopping and the structural strength of coastal facilities such as seawalls or breakwaters as measures of performance, this new criterion can represent the reduction in performance of coastal facilities due to sea level rise or of a greater frequency of tropical cyclones induced by global climate change. This study proposes a probabilistic approach to assess the performance of coastal structures. Using this approach, the time-dependent encounter probability, the return period, and modified residual life are introduced as new indices for making decisions on adaptation strategies. A useful characteristic of these indices is that they make possible the direct comparison of different physical quantities such as wave overtopping and structural strength. Case studies were conducted in order to verify the validity of this approach. The proposed approach is considered to be beneficial in planning an adaptation strategy related to global climate change. A more accurate assessment can be made through case studies of its application. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {The paper presents an Incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (ISPH) method to simulate wave interactions with a porous medium. The SPH method is a mesh free particle modeling approach that is capable of tracking the large deformation of free surfaces in an easy and accurate manner. The ISPH method employs a strict incompressible hydrodynamic formulation to solve the fluid pressure and the numerical solution is obtained by using a two-step semi-implicit scheme. The ISPH flow model solves the unsteady 2D Navier-Stokes (NS) equations for the flows outside the porous media and the NS type model equations for the flows inside the porous media. The presence of porous media is considered by including additional friction forces into the equations. The developed ISPH model is first validated by the solitary and regular waves damping over a porous bed and the solitary wave interacting with a submerged porous breakwater. The convergence of the method and the sensitivity of relevant model parameters are discussed. Then the model is applied to the breaking wave interacting with a breakwater covered with a layer of porous materials. The computational results demonstrate that the ISPH flow model could provide a promising simulation tool in coastal hydrodynamic applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {Assuming the wave steepness of the incident waves and the ship motions are small, the second-order weakly-nonlinear hydrodynamic problem of a ship moving with constant forward speed is studied numerically in a consistent way. The boundary value problem is formulated in a body-fixed coordinate system and the perturbation scheme is used. This formulation does not include any derivatives of the velocity potential on the right-hand side of the body-boundary conditions, and thus avoid the difficulties associated with the terms similar to the so-called mj-terms and their derivatives. The second-order sum-frequency wave excitation of ship springing is studied in both monochromatic and bichromatic head-sea waves. Different Froude numbers are considered. A time-domain Higher-Order Boundary Element Method based on cubic shape function is used as a numerical tool. An upstream finite difference scheme is used for longitudinal derivative terms in the free-surface conditions. For a modified Wigley hull in head-sea waves, it is found that the second-order velocity potential gives dominant contribution to second-order wave excitation of ship springing in the wave frequency region where sum-frequency springing occurs. Quadratic velocity terms in the Bernoulli equation have a relatively small contribution. The numerical results also demonstrate strong dependency of the second-order wave excitation of ship springing on the Froude numbers for small wave lengths. The effect of beam and draft is investigated. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2011.},

A thorough understanding of moored ship dynamics when subjected to waves, wind and current combined with the use of flexible mooring lines would help to design berthing terminals for exposed areas. In this paper, the three dimensional problem of wave interactions with a barge moored to a single point is dealt with, based on the finite element method. The effect of flexibility of the mooring line and the point of mooring on the response of the barge as well as the mooring line tension is investigated. The paper compares the numerical results with model tests carried out on a barge moored to a fixed support under regular and random waves in head sea. The effect of stiffness of the mooring line on the barge response for different mooring points is discussed, which would be useful for the designers. The effect of viscous damping is also considered. The analytical results are in good agreement with the experimental results in both regular and random waves. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The latest of these models vary in their details but now largely agree in their large-scale features, which include significant coseismic slip along the entire 1300- to 1500-km rupture, the bulk of which occurred fast enough to radiate seismic waves. The earthquake's enormous size has challenged conventional processing approaches and stimulated the development of new analysis and inversion methods, including multiple-source inversions, high-frequency body-wave imaging, and satellite observations of tsunami heights and gravity changes.

 abstract = {Combined experimental and numerical study of spatial evolution of unidirectional random water-waves is performed. Numerous realizations of wave fields all having identical initial narrow-banded Gaussian power spectrum but random phases for each harmonic were generated by a wavemaker in a 300 m long wave tank. The measured in the vicinity of the wavemaker temporal variation of the surface elevation was used to determine the initial conditions in the numerical simulations. The cubic Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation (CSE) and the modified nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger (MNLS) set of equations due to Dysthe were used as the theoretical models. The detailed comparison of the evolution of the wave field along the tank in individual realizations, measured by wave gauges at different distances from the wavemaker and computed using the two theoretical models, was performed. Numerous statistical wave parameters were calculated based on the whole ensemble of realizations. Comparison of the spatial variation of the computed statistical characteristics of the random wave field with laboratory measurements indicates that contrary to the deterministic case, ensemble averaged statistical parameters derived from the CSE simulations compare reasonably well with the experiments and with the results derived from the MNLS model simulations. In particular, simulations based on both models indicate that the statistical characteristics of the random wave field depend on the local width of frequency spectrum and deviate from the Gaussian statistics: the probability of extremely large (the so-called freak) waves is highest when the local spectral width attains maximum. In view of the satisfactory agreement of the numerical results with the laboratory experiments, the computational domain was extended to distances exceeding twice the actual length of the tank and long-scale (at distances approaching 200 dominant wavelengths) variation of the statistical parameters is studied. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

 abstract = {This study investigates the interaction between dry debris flows and a rigid barrier through discrete element modeling (DEM) of flume tests. The debris materials were modeled as an assembly of loosely packed spherical particles and the rigid barrier was represented by a layer of fixed particles. The numerical model was validated by comparing the numerical results with the experimental data reported in the literature, in terms of the debris flow morphology and evolution of impact forces acting on the rigid barrier. This model was further employed to examine the influence of barrier slope on the debris-barrier interactions. Based on the numerical results, three interaction stages were identified, namely the frontal impact, run-up and pile-up. The maximum impact force measured in this study exhibits a power law dependence on the barrier slope. In addition, during the impact process, the majority of initial total energy was dissipated by particle-particle and particle-flume interactions, while only a negligibly small amount of energy was dissipated by particle-barrier interaction. The numerical results also indicate that long spreading debris flows are very effective in facilitating energy dissipation, diminishing the impact force acting on the rigid barrier. These considerations can finally contribute to the design of effective debris flow barriers.},

 abstract = {In two dimensions, a constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) respects a set of segments that constrain the edges of the triangula-tion, while still maintaining most of the favorable properties of ordinary Delaunay triangulations (such as maximizing the minimum angle). CDTs solve the problem of enforcing boundary conformity ensuring that triangulation edges cover the boundaries (both interior and exterior) of the domain being modeled. This paper discusses the three-dimensional analogue, constrained Delaunay tetrahedralizations (also called CDTs), and their advantages in mesh generation. CDTs maintain most of the favorable properties of ordinary Delaunay tetrahedralizations, but they are more difficult to work with, because some sets of constraining segments and facets simply do not have CDTs. However, boundary conformity can always be enforced by judicious insertion of additional vertices, combined with CDTs. This approach has three advantages over other methods for boundary recovery: it usually requires fewer additional vertices to be inserted, it yields provably good bounds on edge lengths (i.e. edges are not made unnecessarily short), and it interacts well with provably good Delaunay refinement methods for tetrahedral mesh generation. },

 abstract = {A time-domain 3D Rankine panel method based on a simplified variant of the mixed Eulerian–Lagrangian scheme under certain approximations is developed for studying steep nonlinear waves interacting with practical ship and offshore configurations at zero speed. Appropriate techniques have been developed that enable the method to produce very long-duration simulation results. Two levels of time-domain computations are performed: (1) a fully linear formulation where all external forces are computed on the mean wetted surface, and (2) an approximate nonlinear computation where the hydrodynamics interaction forces (diffraction and radiation forces) are determined on the mean surface and the forces arising from the incident steep waves and hydrostatic restoring forces are determined based upon the exact wetted surface under the nonlinear incident wave. Numerical computations for three practical marine structures, the barge, the S175 hull, and the semisubmersible are presented. The linear computations for which very long-duration simulations are achievable from the present method are validated against results from other available methods. As the method is developed for stationary floating bodies undergoing oscillation about their mean location, it cannot be applied for a fully unrestrained body which can freely drift. In absence of physical restraints, the approximate nonlinear calculation requires imposition of artificial constraints partially or fully restraining the horizontal motions. Very long-duration simulations under the influence of steep nonlinear large-amplitude waves for all the three structures considered could be achieved. Comparative studies between different force and motion components in large-amplitude waves from linear and the approximate nonlinear computations are made to bring out the influence of the incident wave nonlinearities on these structures. It is found that the nonlinearities of the forces and motions are strongly dependent on the above water hull geometry. Compared to a small water-plane area hull (the semisubmersible), or a wall-sided hull (the barge), a flared hull (S175) results in pronounced nonlinear features in the forces and motion time-histories.},

 abstract = {Lanzarote (Canary Islands, Spain) is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (since 1993) located in the Atlantic Ocean. The island is aiming to change its energy production model in order to reduce its dependence on external, fossil-fuel-based energy sources. The local authorities hope to develop an energy production model based on clean, renewable sources, such as wave energy converters (WECs). This study analyses the island's wave energy resources using a 51-year series of data obtained from numerical modelling (hindcast and forecast). The spatial distribution of wave power is analysed using data from nine points around the island. Significant resources (average wave power exceeding 30 kW/m and average annual wave energy of more than 270 MW h/m) are found to the north of the island, as well as to the west and the east (average wave power 25–30 kW/m). Considerable seasonal variability is found, with winters being rather high-energetic and summers quite mild. Variability coefficients are computed in order to select the best locations for WECs; the composition of the resource at each location is examined in terms of sea states in order to evaluate the suitability of WEC installation. Finally, three sites with similar conditions, all located on the north side of the island, are selected as the best candidates for WEC deployment.},

@article{Simmonds1986,
 abstract = {Undergraduates in engineering and the physical sciences receive a thorough introduction to perturbation theory in this useful and accessible text. Students discover methods for obtaining an approximate solution of a mathematical problem by exploiting the presence of a small, dimensionless parameter — the smaller the parameter, the more accurate the approximate solution. Knowledge of perturbation theory offers a twofold benefit: approximate solutions often reveal the exact solution's essential dependence on specified parameters; also, some problems resistant to numerical solutions may yield to perturbation methods. In fact, numerical and perturbation methods can be combined in a complementary way.The text opens with a well-defined treatment of finding the roots of polynomials whose coefficients contain a small parameter. Proceeding to differential equations, the authors explain many techniques for handling perturbations that reorder the equations or involve an unbounded independent variable. Two disparate practical problems that can be solved efficiently with perturbation methods conclude the volume.Written in an informal style that moves from specific examples to general principles, this elementary text emphasizes the "why" along with the "how"; prerequisites include a knowledge of one-variable calculus and ordinary differential equations. This newly revised second edition features an additional appendix concerning the approximate evaluation of integrals.},

 abstract = {The second-order hydrodynamics of a semisubmersible offshore wind turbine is investigated in this paper by analyzing and proposing a set of different options for estimating the slow-drift motions during its design. A case study consisting of a three-floater semisubmersible designed to support a 1.5Mw turbine is considered. An experimental campaign focused on characterizing second-order surge response was carried out and its most salient results are documented in the paper. The campaign was conducted in two different facilities and comprised decay tests, regular, bichromatic and irregular waves. Wind has not been considered in this phase of the research. Numerical modeling with frequency domain solver WAMIT has been carried out. Due to location depth and mooring length restrictions, the natural periods of horizontal excursions are smaller than those of well studied DeepCwind platform. This may change the importance of the different second-order components, something investigated in present research by comparing simplified and full Quadratic Transfer Functions (QTF) computations. Results obtained with experiments and simulations are compared, focusing on the mean and slow-drift motions and forces. It is shown that the Newman approximation underestimates the second-order response in some cases while the white noise model retains the main physics involved, a novel result which may change the paradigm for mooring design of these artifacts in the near future.},

@article{Singh2019,
 abstract = {The main objective of this work is to mimic and model pectoral fins based locomotion mechanisms observed in various labriform fishes like box-fish, angel fish, etc. accounting the previous problems using rigid joint connection for fins. The hydrodynamic forces acting on the pectoral fin are evaluated for a quasi-static state using blade element approach while taking into account the added mass. Implementing Newton–Euler equations, the kinematics and the dynamics of a free-swimming robot-fish are obtained. Thus, an analytical model is derived to calculate net forces and torques generated throughout the gait. Apart from a parametric study, simulations are performed to predict various output parameters like thrust, acceleration and swimming speed for some specific locomotion. For experimental validation, a rigid fish-like-body is fabricated with a pair of fins attached symmetrically on lateral sides of the body. Each fin is actuated using three servo-motors in [Ry Rz Ry] configurations to exhibit both the rowing and flapping gaits. A micro-controller is deployed to control the actuators by generating pulse-width modulation and read inertial sensors (a gyroscope and an accelerometer mounted at the centroid of the body) using I2C protocol. In addition, a Bluetooth module is also attached to it for communicating the sensor's readouts to a computer (running MATLAB script). To achieve some specific motions of rowing gait, the fins are actuated appropriately while the robot is freely submerged underwater and the sensor's data are recorded in real-time for parallel observations. Based on video motion analysis and the sensed data, the values of acceleration are calculated and compared with the theoretical values predicted by the model.},

Several resource assessment studies have been performed for the site, but the published results are high-level and predicted power availability varies significantly. This paper provides a detailed overview and re-analysis of the multiple datasets used in the original studies, which consisted of a combination of physical measurement and numerical modelling. The quality of the datasets is assessed, and reasons for the discrepancies between predicted resource levels investigated. Results from a SWAN model for the region illustrate significant levels of spatial variability in the resource due to the complexity of the local bathymetry, and examination of long-term global model datasets shows notable inter-annual variability. It is thus concluded that a resource assessment methodology utilising datasets from multiple locations and of short duration significantly reduces the accuracy of the predicted levels of resource. From these results, key learnings for future developments are discussed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {Plunging breakers are beyond the reach of all known analytical approximations. Previous numerical computations have succeeded only in integrating the equations of motion up to the instant when the surface becomes vertical. In this paper we present a new method for following the time-history of space-periodic irrotational surface waves. The only independent variables are the coordinates and velocity potential of marked particles at the free surface. At each time-step an integral equation is solved for the new normal component of velocity. The method is faster and more accurate than previous methods based on a two dimensional grid. It has also the advantage that the marked particles become concentrated near regions of sharp curvature. Viscosity and surface tension are both neglected. The method is tested on a free, steady wave of finite amplitude, and is found to give excellent agreement with independent calculations based on Stokes's series. It is then applied to unsteady waves, produced by initially applying an asymmetric distribution of pressure to a symmetric, progres­sive wave. The freely running wave then steepens and overturns. It is demonstrated that the surface remains rounded till well after the over­turning takes place.},

In our method, incompressibility is enforced by using a prediction-correction scheme to determine the particle pressures. For this, the information about density fluctuations is actively propagated through the fluid and pressure values are updated until the targeted density is satisfied. With this approach, we avoid the computational expenses of solving a pressure Poisson equation, while still being able to use large time steps in the simulation.

 abstract = {In this paper an attempt is made to give a survey of the mathematical approach to the description of the swimming of fish. This type of investigation is of interest because it gives insight in the fundamentals of the interaction of the body of the fish and the fluid. Sir James Lighthill considered this problem in a very lively way by showing that simple ideas can be the nucleus of deep mathematical investigations. He and, besides him, T.Y. Wu can most probably be regarded as the founders of the hydrodynamical description of fish locomotion. They have stimulated many capable theoreticians to contribute to this rich field of beautiful problems. Of course, the mathematical investigations were stimulated by the many experimental discoveries already made earlier by prominent biologists.},

 abstract = {Hawaii's access to the ocean and remoteness from fuel supplies has sparked an interest in ocean waves as a potential resource to meet the increasing demand for sustainable energy. The wave resources include swells from distant storms and year-round seas generated by trade winds passing through the islands. This study produces 10 years of hindcast data from a system of mesoscale atmospheric and spectral wave models to quantify the wind and wave climate as well as nearshore wave energy resources in Hawaii. A global WAVEWATCH III (WW3) model forced by surface winds from the Final Global Tropospheric Analysis (FNL) reproduces the swell and seas from the far field and a nested Hawaii WW3 model with high-resolution winds from the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model capture the local wave processes. The Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model nested inside Hawaii WW3 provides data in coastal waters, where wave energy converters are being considered for deployment. The computed wave heights show good agreement with data from satellites and buoys. Bi-monthly median and percentile plots show persistent trade winds throughout the year with strong seasonal variation of the wave climate. The nearshore data shows modulation of the wave energy along the coastline due to the undulating volcanic island bathymetry and demonstrates its importance in selecting suitable sites for wave energy converters.},

 abstract = {Experiments have been performed in the Shallow Water Wave Basin of DHI (H{\o}rsholm, Denmark), on large arrays of up to 25 heaving point absorber type Wave Energy Converters (WECs), for a range of geometric layout configurations and wave conditions. WEC response and modifications of the wave field are measured to provide data for understanding WEC array interactions and to evaluate array interaction numerical models. Each WEC consists of a buoy with a diameter of 0.315 m and power take-off (PTO) is modeled by realizing friction based energy dissipation through damping of the WEC's motion. Wave gauges are located within and around the WEC array. Wave conditions studied include regular, polychromatic, long- and short-crested irregular waves. A rectilinear arrangement of WEC support structures is employed such that several array configurations can be studied. In this paper, the experimental arrangement and the obtained database are presented. Also, results for wave height attenuation downwave a rectilinear array of 25 heaving WECs are presented, for the case of irregular waves. Up to 16.3% and 18.1% (long-crested) and 11.2% and 18.1% (short-crested waves) reduction in significant wave height is observed downwave the WEC array, for the radiated wave field only and for the combination of incident-diffracted-radiated (perturbed) wave field, respectively. Using spectra at different locations within and around the array, the wave field modifications are presented and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

@article{Subbulakshmi2022,
 abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been rapid increase in the offshore wind turbine installations. The future installations will see a progression from shallow to deep waters. It necessitates the development of innovative floating platforms to support the offshore wind turbines capable of resisting coupled wind and wave forces to meet the exponential growth of energy demand. The floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) is a complex dynamic system. There exists coupling and interaction between aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, servodynamics, structural dynamics and mooring dynamics. Various analysis methods have been developed over the time to model the complex behaviour of FOWT system and to accurately predict its response. These methods can be classified as uncoupled, partially coupled and fully coupled methods based on their degree of coupling. Each of these methods can be utilized in the specific stages of the design. This paper provides an integrated review of the recent advances in the experimental and numerical methods used for the dynamic analysis of the FOWT. Various software tools used for the numerical analysis of FOWT are also reviewed in this paper. Fully coupled experimental analysis is usually carried out using real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) in the laboratory environment. Several possible configurations of RTHS based on different partitioning schemes are also discussed. This paper encapsulates the different methods available in the literature and will be useful for further building up the research in the analysis of FOWTs. Finally, this paper is complemented with the technical challenges and future scope identified based on the review.},

The model considers the conditions of a fish swimming in ocean current perturbations similar to the ocean current perturbations of the slender-body autonomous underwater vehicles. For swimming and turning behaviors, a nonlinear, dynamic, carangiform locomotion model is derived by using a planar four-link model. A 2-DOF barycenter mechanism is proposed to provide body stabilization and to serve as an actuating device for active control design. A barycenter control scheme is developed to change the center of gravity of the robot fish body by moving balancing masses along two axes. The projected torque on x and y axes propel pitch and roll angles to the desired settings. A Stabilizing controller, fish-tail mechanism, rigid body dynamics, and kinematics are incorporated to enable the fish robot to move in three dimensional space. Simulation results have demonstrated maneuverability and control system performance of the developed controller which is proposed to conduct path tracking of the robot fish as it swims under current perturbations.},

To compute the motions of a rigid body, the fluid pressure at the position of each particle on the body surface was directly integrated in space and the equations of translational and rotational motions were integrated in time to determine the correct position of the rigid-body surface at each time step of the time-domain calculation. The performance of this method was validated through a comparison with measured results in an experiment that was newly conducted using a model of a box-shaped floating body with a small freeboard. Although the overall agreement was good, some discrepancies were observed for a shorter wave period, especially for the drift motion in sway. The effect of numerical resolution on the results was checked by changing the number of particles. With a higher number of particles, no obvious improvement was seen in the global body motions, but the resolution of the local free-surface profile, including the water on deck, was improved.},

 abstract = {The effects of long-term sea-level rise and offshore wave-height increase due to climate change on the stability of caisson breakwaters constructed in different water depths are analyzed by using a time-dependent performance-based design method. An artificial neural network is combined with the wave transformation model to reduce the computation time in the Monte Carlo simulation. The breakwater is designed by the conventional safety-factor method, while its performance is evaluated by the expected sliding distance. In general, the stability of the breakwater is reduced if the climate change effects are included, but it shows different trends depending on water depth. Outside the surf zone, the effect of sea-level rise decreases with increasing water depth, whereas that of wave-height increase increases with water depth. Inside the surf zone, however, both effects decrease with decreasing water depth, with greater effect of wave-height increase than sea-level rise. In the design of a caisson breakwater of ordinary importance, it is not necessary to take into account the effect of sea-level rise, whereas the effect of wave-height increase should be taken into account if the breakwater is constructed far outside the surf zone. However, it should be noted that different results should be obtained if the breakwater were designed based on the expected sliding distance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Fish commonly execute rapid linear accelerations initiated during steady swimming, yet the function of the median fins during this process is less understood. We find that the erection/folding time (from the starting time of the linear acceleration (0 s) to the starting time of the folding movement of the fin), as well as the spreading area of the median fins, actively change during the linear acceleration of the live largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). To better understand the influence of the folding time and the area change of the median fins on the linear acceleration, we implemented an undulatory biomimetic robotic fish with soft median fins that can be programmed to erect and fold, just like a live fish. To characterize the acceleration performance of the robotic fish, we developed a “self-propelled” experiment technique based on the Kalman filter and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control algorithm. The experiments on the robotic fish show the acceleration induced by fully-erected median fins increases by 46.3%. Fully-erected median fins positively contribute to propulsion primarily at the onset stage of the linear acceleration while result in a significant decrease in steady swimming speed by 25%, which suggests a large drag force is induced at the steady swimming stage due to the enlarged wetted area. Parametric sweeping experiments on erection/folding time and spreading area demonstrate a proper combination of the erection/folding time and the spreading area enhances the mean linear acceleration by up to 85%. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) results reveal that the vortexes shed by the erected dorsal fin are stronger than those shed by the folded fin. As the acceleration process progresses, the thrust generated by the dorsal fins gradually is weakened until only resistance is generated in the end.

 abstract = {With the increase of ship size, the stiffness of the hull structure becomes smaller. This means that the frequency of wave excitation tends to be closer to the natural frequency of the hull vibration, which in turn makes the hydroelastic responses more significant. An accurate assessment of the wave loads and motion responses of hulls is the key to ship design and safety assessment. In this paper, the coupled CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics)-FEM (Finite Element Method) method is used to investigate the non-linear hydroelasticity effect of a 6750-TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit) container ship. First, by comparing the heave, pitch, and vertical bending moment at midship section (VBM4) against experimental results reported in the literature, the validity of the numerical method in this paper is illustrated. Secondly, the ship responses under different wave length–ship length ratio, wave frequency-structure natural frequency, wave steepness, and ship speeds are studied. It is found that the wave length–ship length ratio has a more important influence on the hydroelastic response than that from wave frequency-structure natural frequency ratio, and the effect of wave non-linearity will behave differently under different wave length–ship length ratio. The increase of rigid body motion caused by forward speed will not correspondingly increase the non-linearity of the hydroelastic response.},

 abstract = {A simple pendulum is an idealization of a real pendulum. It consists of an infinitely light rigid rod attached to a frictionless pivot point, and a point mass attached to the free end of rigid rod. The motion of the simple pendulum is described by an angle displacement of the pendulum from its vertical equilibrium position. For small amplitude of the angle, the motion of a simple pendulum is well described by a linear simple harmonics. For the large angle, on the other hand, the motion of the simple pendulum is described by a nonlinear differential equation. In this sense, the simple pendulum exhibits a variety of motions, depending on the angles. Because of the difficulty in solving the nonlinear differential equation, the physics of the simple pendulum for the large angle has not been taught sufficiently at least in Introductory Physics Course, in spite of strong interest of students. The present lecture note was originally written as a part of the lecture note for students taking the Introductory Physics (Phys.131) as one of advanced topics. It is a revised form of the original lecture notes. Here we discuss the time dependence of the angle when the initial angular velocity is changed as a parameter. The nonlinear differential equations are also solved numerically using the Mathematica (NDSolve). The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to analyze the higher harmonics of the oscillating waves. The nature of the nonlinearity is strongly enhanced as the angle approaches 180 {\textordmasculine} . The time dependence of the angle changes from sinusoidal wave to square wave having many higher harmonics. The period of the wave becomes longer. The trajectories in the phase space of angular velocity vs the angle is strongly dependent on the degree of the nonlinearity. The numerical method is not so powerful in the simple pendulum since the exact solution can be given by Jacobi elliptic functions. When the perturbation effect in a system such as a resistive pendulum, is added to the unperturbed system, however, the numerical method is so useful. It greatly helps us to understand the nature of nonlinearity in the dynamic system. As a typical example, the differential equation of the resistive pendulum with an external torque is the same as that of the Josephson junction in the superconductivity. This means that the there is an exact correspondence between the dynamics of the Josephson junction and the dynamics of pendulum. In this sense, the study on the physics of simple pendulum with linearity and nonlinearity is a key to our understanding the nonlinear dynamics of many other systems. There have been several excellent textbooks on the simple pendulum, including the books written},

 abstract = {A B S T R A C T Estimation of wave overtopping over the crest of coastal structures is crucial to design effective and cost efficient countermeasures against storms. Semi-empirical formulas are often used for wave overtopping assessment, but they are not always applicable for complex structures which exist in reality (e.g. a storm wall on a dike in a shallow or very shallow foreshore). Detailed numerical models such as Eulerian and Lagrangian RANS models have potential to simulate overtopping of complex coastal structures with good accuracy. However such models require significant computational resources. The use of such models is often not feasible for the design of coastal structures, which often requires multiple iterations and model runs over a reasonably long period of time (e.g. wave trains with 1000 individual waves). In this paper we investigated the applicability of the simplified depth integrated wave transformation model SWASH for wave overtopping estimation of impermeable coastal structures in shallow foreshores. The validation results demonstrate the capability of SWASH to predict mean wave overtopping discharge with good accuracy compared to results from four different overtopping experimental campaigns (comprising 124 individual cases). The overall performance of SWASH to estimate mean wave overtopping discharge is as accurate as those obtained by semi-empirical equations in literature. However, in order to obtain accurate mean wave overtopping discharge with the SWASH model, the incident wave properties at the toe of the dike need to be accurately reproduced. For cases where this is not possible, a correction method is proposed in this paper. Detailed validation of the instantaneous wave overtopping also shows a good agreement with physical model data. In one example, a single, intensive overtopping event was not well resolved by the SWASH model and the instantaneous wave overtopping was under-predicted. However, this did not contribute significantly to the mean wave overtopping discharge. An additional advantage of the SWASH model is that specific coastal structure geometries can be modelled in SWASH if they are not covered by semi-empirical equations. Even in a case with rapidly varied flow (e.g. vertical wall on a dike) the model shows sufficient robustness. In this paper the details on the SWASH model configuration and post processing methods are outlined to enable the reader to reproduce reliable wave overtopping estimation over impermeable coastal structures in shallow foreshores.},

Regional, seasonal, and chronological variation of the incoming wave energy are analyzed by using the wave observation data from 1975 to 1978. According to the macro-scopic calculation, the average wave energy per one meter of the coastal line for 4 years is 6.0kW and the total wave energy amounts to 3.1 *10 7kW on a whole Japanese Coast which is assumed to be 5,200km on this calculation. This amount is equivalent to 30% of the total electlic supply of Japan in 1978. From the view point of the regional variation, the Pacific Ocean and Japanese Sea sides of the main island are the predominant areas. The wave energy on the Japanese Sea sides amounts to 17.4kW/m in winter. The wave energy varies with season and this tendency is great on the Japanese Sea sides. This maximum average of wave energy of each year is 6.6kW/m which is appeared in 1976. The others are 10 to 20% smaller than the value of 1976.},

 abstract = {Numerical simulations were performed to investigate current-induced modulation of the spectral and statistical properties of ocean waves advected by idealized and realistic current fields. In particular, the role of nonlinear energy transfer among waves in wave–current interactions is examined. In this type of numerical simulation, it is critical to treat the nonlinear transfer function (Snl) properly, because a rigorous Snl algorithm incurs a huge computational cost. However, the applicability of the widely used discrete interaction approximation (DIA) method is strictly limited for complex wave fields. Therefore, the simplified RIAM (SRIAM) method is implemented in an operational third-generation wave model. The method approximates an infinite resonant quadruplet with 20 optimized resonance configurations. The performance of the model is assessed by applying it to fetch-limited wave growth and wave propagation against a shear current. Numerical simulations using the idealized current field revealed that the Snl retained spectral form by redistributing the refracted wave energy; this suggests that energy concentration due to ray focusing is dispersed via the self-stabilization effect of nonlinear transfer. A hindcast simulation using wind and current reanalysis data indicated that the difference in the average monthly wave height was substantial and that instantaneous wave–current interactions were highly sensitive to small current structures. Spectral shape was also modulated, and the spatial distributions of the directional bandwidth with or without current data were completely different. Moreover, the self-stabilization effect of the Snl was also confirmed in a realistic situation. These results indicate that a realistic representation of the current field is crucial for high-resolution wave forecasting.},

The experimental results indicate that the influence of the rotations of a vertical-axis wind turbine on the sway drift force is generally not very significant.

The focus was on the characteristics of mean drift load and its optimization potential. The present numerical results indicated that the application of moonpools was useful in reducing horizontal mean drift force at specific frequencies, and the reason was ascribed to the significant radiation effect of the resonant water oscillations in moonpools. The observed reduction effect on mean drift force was shown to be dependent on the viscous damping of moonpool resonance. The experimental results showed that the maximum response of the mean sway drift force was reduced by the gyroscopic effect of rotations of the vertical-axis wind turbine, and this reduction effect became stronger as the rotating speed of the wind turbine increased, but was weakened as wave amplitude increased. The comparisons between experimental data and potential flow predictions indicated that viscous effects should be taken into account to reasonably estimate the mean wave drift forces on barge-type floating wind turbines.},

However, from an academic perspective, this theme is so broad that most educators and researchers tend to focus on just one aspect, and maintaining the broad viewpoint which is necessary for making strategic judgments becomes difficult. Tohoku University addressed this challenge when developing a new education and training program for environmental leaders and brought together the extensive range of expertise available in specific fields into one special course which forms the basis of this book. Now in one volume, both students and educators can be brought up to date on a wide range of critical issues currently being addressed in the field of energy and resources. Issues covered include several critical ones in the energy field (low-energy technologies, renewable energies such as the hydrogen economy, and geothermal energy). Chapters on resources include availability (for instance, rare earth metals), extraction and recycling of metals and plastics, and technological solutions to specific waste-disposal problems. In addition, broader strategic issues such as limits to growth and the interaction between the economic system and environmental issues are addressed.

 abstract = {This study aims to investigate the influence of fishnet mesh size on a floating platform. A self-developed, time-domain numerical model was used for the evaluation. This model is based on potential flow theory, uses the boundary element method (BEM) to solve nonlinear wave-body interactions, and applies the Morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic forces exerted on fishnets. The mooring system is treated as a linear and symmetric spring. The results near the resonant frequency of the platform indicate that the smaller the fishnet mesh size, the lower the heave, pitch, and sea-side tension response amplitude operators (RAOs), but the higher the reflection coefficient. The results in the lower frequency region reveal that the smaller the fishnet mesh size, the lower the surge and heave RAOs, but the higher the pitch and tension RAOs. Meanwhile, the time-domain results at the resonant frequency of heave motion are shown to indicate the influences of a platform with various fishnets mesh sizes on the rigid body motion, mooring line tension, and transmitted wave heights. In addition, a comparison of nonlinear effects indicates that, after reducing the fishnet mesh size, the second-order RAOs of heave, pitch, and sea-side tension decrease, but the changes are minor against the first-order results.},

The mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian method is utilized for the free surface. To calculate the accurate hydrodynamic pressure on the body surface, that is to calculate the accurate acceleration of body, both the velocity field and the acceleration field combined with the equations of body motions are solved. This method enables us to keep the dynamic equilibrium of forces between fluid and floating body on every time step. The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is used to solve the field equations. For illustration, two computational examples are presented in comparison with the experimental data : (i) a transient motion of midship section body in an incident wave ; (ii) a growth of par-ametric oscillation of roll motion of flare shaped body in a regular wave. These examples show that the computational results are in excellent agreement with measured body motions.},

 abstract = {Due to the convenience and flexibility in modeling complex geometries and deformable objects, local ghost particles methods are becoming more and more popular. In the present study, a novel local semi-fixed ghost particles method is proposed for weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (WCSPH). In comparison with the previous local ghost particles methods, the new boundary method can effectively reduce spurious pressure oscillations and smooth the flow field. Besides, the new generation mechanism of fictitious particles is simple and robust, which is suitable for all kinds of kernel functions with different sizes of the support domain. The numerical accuracy and stability of the new smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme are validated for several typical benchmark cases. A detailed investigation into the pressure on solid walls and the surface elevation in dynamic simulations is also conducted. A comparison of numerical results shows that the new boundary method helps reduce the oscillations in the numerical solutions and improves the numerical accuracy of the pressure field.},

Past interest in wave groups has mostly been focused on the statistics and modeling of linear wave groups. Studies on nonlinear wave groups are surprisingly few, and address deep water waves only. Here, statistics of nonlinear wave crests and wave-crest groups in deep and transitional water depths are considered, using an appropriate second-order representation for crest heights and the continuous wave-envelope approach. In particular, theoretical expressions describing the statistics of nonlinear wave crests and their groups are posed in the form of a simple second-order transformation of well-known results on linear waves. Predictions from the transformation so posed compare well with nonlinear wave data gathered in the North Sea, and demonstrate that nonlinearities do affect the statistics of large wave crests and their groups significantly.},

 abstract = {Theoretical distributions proposed for describing the crest-to-trough heights of linear waves are reviewed briefly. To explore the effects of nonlinearities, these are generalized to second-order waves, utilizing quasi-deterministic results on the expected shape of large waves. The efficacy of Gram-Charlier models in describing the effects of third-order nonlinearities on the distributions of wave heights, crests and troughs are examined in detail. All models and a fifth-order Stokes-Rayleigh type model recently proposed are compared with linear and nonlinear waves simulated from the JONSWAP spectrum representative of long-crested extreme seas, and also with oceanic data gathered in the North Sea. Uncertainties arising from the variability of probability estimates derived from sample populations of limited size are considered. Ultimately, the comparisons show that nonlinearities do not have any discernable effect on the crest-to-trough heights of oceanic waves. Most of the linear models considered yield similar and reasonable predictions of the observed data trends. Gram-Charlier type distributions seem neither effective nor particularly useful in describing the statistics of large wave heights or crests under oceanic conditions. However, they do surprisingly well in predicting unusually large wave heights and crests observed in some 2D wave-flume experiments and 3D numerical simulations of long-crested narrow-band random waves. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Strong near-shore earthquakes are the most frequent sources of tsunamis in many oceans of the world. In the framework of the nonlinear shallow-water theory, the initial sea-surface tsunami elevation is assumed to equal the sea-floor co-seismic displacement produced by the seismic event. This is quantified by means of the analytical formulas due to Okada (1985, 1992), dealing with seismic faults buried in an elastic medium. In this work the propagation of tsunamis is studied along two- dimensional profiles on an idealized constant-slope sea bed, an approximation that allows one to reduce the governing nonlinear equations to a linear problem by means of the classical Carrier & Greenspan (1958) approach. We introduce an analytical solution that is sufficiently general to account for initial conditions associated with paradigmatic cases of sea-bottom deformations produced by near-shore earthquakes, such as subsidence or uplift of the coastal area, and can be also used to treat more complex deformations. The main result is that the amplification of the tsunami height at the coast is found to range between approximately 1 and 2. The amplification is around 1 for tsunamis induced by earthquakes with their epicentre inland and tends to grow as the fault moves seaward. We restrict our analysis to earthquakes that dislocate the shore region. Within the class of sources that we consider, the tsunamis that are most amplified are the ones having initial profiles with a crest–trough–crest system or conversely with a trough–crest–trough system. The bottom slope is found to have no effect on tsunami run-ups and run-downs, but to influence tsunami periods and tsunami speed remarkably. Breaking analysis shows that wave breaking does not occur if the initial wave height is less than 8–9 m, and that the simplest sea-level profiles, which are associated with earthquakes with their epicentre on land, are not expected to break even if their initial height exceeds 19m.},

 abstract = {Wave power devices offer great prospects for the marine renewable energy sector. But in comparison to wind energy, wave power is still in its infancy, mainly prototype-based, with technological gaps akin to those experienced in the wind sector some 15 years ago. Several aspects that did not seem significant at a first glance in the design phase, such as the interaction with the marine environment, turned out to be important when the first prototypes were put in the water. In fact, these devices have to face great challenges once at sea and several prototypes have not survived. Firstly, ocean waves are not such an innocuous, predictable flow of water and secondly, life thrives in the ocean. Wave power devices are perfect artificial reefs suitable for algal growth and colonization by many species. And they will have to sustain harsh conditions for over two decades while producing energy. For obvious reasons, there is a lack of existing literature on the subject. In this short review we address a simple question: how tough will the life of wave power devices at sea be? The answer is based on available evidence. We provide as well some ideas to take up the challenge.},

 abstract = {A numerical solution for the 2+1 (long-shore and onshore propagation directions and time) nonlinear shallow-water wave equations without friction factors or artificial viscosity is presented. The models use a splitting method to generate two 1+1 propagation problems, one in the onshore and the other in long-shore direction. Both are solved in characteristic form using the method of characteristics. A shoreline algorithm is implemented, which is the generalization of the earlier 1+1 algorithm used in the code VTCS-2. The model is validated using large-scale laboratory data from solitary wave experiments attacking a conical island. The method is applied then to model the 1993 Okushiri, Japan, the 1994 Kuril Island, Russia, and the 1996 Chimbote, Peru tsunamis. It is found that the model can reproduce correctly overland flow and even extreme events such as the 30m runup and the 20m/s inundation velocities inferred during field surveys. The results suggest that bathymetric and topographic resolution of at least 150m is necessary for adequate predictions, while at least 50m resolution is needed to model extreme events, contrary to intuitive expectations that long waves would not interact with morphological features of such short scales.},

 abstract = {It is well established that third-order nonlinearity produces a strong deviation from Gaussian statistics in water of infinite depth, provided the wave field is long crested, narrow banded and sufficiently steep. A reduction of thirdorder effects is however expected when the wave energy is distributed on a wide range of directions. In water of arbitrary depth, on the other hand, third-order effects tend to be suppressed by finite depth effects if waves are long crested. Numerical simulations of the truncated potential Euler equations are here used to address the combined effect of directionality and finite depth on the statistical properties of surface gravity waves; only relative water depth kh greater than 0.8 are here considered. Results show that random directional wave fields in intermediate water depths, kh=O(1), weakly deviate from Gaussian statistics independently of the degree of directional spreading of the wave energy.},

Here, mechanically generated waves in a three-dimensional basin and numerical simulations of nonlinear waves have been compared in order to assess the ability of numerical models to describe the evolution of weakly nonlinear waves and predict the probability of occurrence of extreme waves within a variety of random directional wave fields. Numerical simulations have been performed following two different approaches: numerical integration of a modified nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation and numerical integration of the potential Euler equations based on a higher-order spectral method. Whereas the first makes a narrow-banded approximation (both in frequency and direction), the latter is free from bandwidth constraints. Both models assume weakly nonlinear waves. On the whole, it has been found that the statistical properties of numerically simulated wave fields are in good quantitative agreement with laboratory observations. Moreover, this study shows that the modified nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation can also provide consistent results outside its narrow-banded domain of validity.},

 abstract = {Traditionally, the directional distribution of ocean waves has been regarded as unimodal, with energy concentrated mainly on the wind direction. However, numerical experiments and field measurements have already demonstrated that the energy of short waves tends to be accumulated along two off-wind directions, generating a bimodal directional distribution. Here, numerical simulations of the potential Euler equations are used to investigate the temporal evolution of initially unimodal directional wave spectra. Because this approach does not include external forcing such as wind and breaking dissipation, spectral changes are only driven by nonlinear interactions. The simulations show that the wave energy spreads outward from the spectral peak, following two characteristic directions. As a result, the directional distribution develops a bimodal form as the wavefield evolves. Although bimodal properties are more pronounced in the high wave number part of the spectrum, in agreement with previous field measurements, the simulations also show that directional bimodality characterizes the spectral peak.},

@article{TONKIN2003,
 abstract = {A series of scale-model experiments investigated the scouring mechanisms associated with a tsunami impinging on a coastal cylindrical structure. Since scaling effects are significant in sediment transport, a large-scale sediment tank was used. Video images from inside the cylinder elucidated the vortex structures and the time development of scour around the cylinder. The scour development and mechanisms differed according to the sediment substrate - sand or gravel. For gravel, the most rapid scour coincided with the greatest flow velocities. On the other hand, for the sand substrate, the most rapid scour occurred at the end of drawdown - after flow velocities had subsided and shear stresses were presumed to have decreased. This behaviour can be explained in terms of pore pressure gradients. As the water level and velocity subside, the pressure on the sediment bed decreases, creating a vertical pressure gradient within the sand and decreasing the effective stress within the sand. Gravel is too porous to sustain this pressure gradient. During drawdown, the surface pressure decreases approximately linearly from a sustained peak at DeltaP to zero over time DeltaT. The critical fraction Lambda of the buoyant weight of sediment supported by the pore pressure gradient can be estimated as Lambda= 2/rootpi Delta/gammabrootc(nu)DeltaT, in which gamma(b) is the buoyant specific weight of the saturated sediment and c(nu) is the coefficient of consolidation. Much deeper scour was observed where Lambda exceeded one-half.},

 abstract = {Kinetic energy extraction devices for ocean and river flows are often located in the\nvicinity of the fluid free surface. This differs from wind turbines where the atmosphere\nmay be considered to extend to infinity for the purposes of numerical modelling. As\nmost kinetic energy extraction devices are based on lifting surfaces, a numerical model\nis sought which can model both lifting and free surface flows. One such model is the\nboundary element method which has been successfully applied to free surface problems\nand to lifting flows as well as the combined problem.\nThis study seeks to develop a high order boundary element method that is capable\nof modelling unsteady lifting and free surface flows in three dimensions. Although high\norder formulations of boundary element methods are common for free surface problems,\nproviding improved accuracy and computational time, their usage for lifting flows is\nless frequent. This may be due to the hypersingular boundary integral equation (HBIE)\nwhich must be solved in order to find the velocity of the vortex wakes behind lifting\nsurfaces.\nIn previous lifting flow studies using high order boundary element methods the\nwake velocities have been determined at the element centres and then interpolated to\nthe collocation points. Not until the paper of Gray et al. (2004b) has a method been\navailable for the direct solution of the HBIEs at the edges of three dimensional high\norder elements with C0 continuous interfaces. The solution employs a technique known\nas the Galerkin boundary element method.\nThis study shows, for the first time, that the Galerkin boundary element method is\napplicable to the solution of the HBIE on the vortex wake of a lifting body. The\napplication of the technique is then demonstrated as part of the numerical model\ndeveloped herein. The model is based on the high order boundary element method\ndeveloped by Xu (1992) for non-linear free surface flows. This formulation is extended\nto include steady uniform flow throughout the computational domain as well as the\npresence of lifting and non-lifting bodies. Several verification cases are implemented to\ntest the accuracy of the model.},

 abstract = {The boundary-element method is used to solve Stokes equations for periodic arrays of force-free and torque-free rigid particles. Simple cubic arrays of spheres, spheroids, cubes, and clusters of spheres are subjected to a bulk simple shearing flow. The effective volume-averaged stress tensor for the suspension and the detailed velocity and stress fields throughout the Newtonian suspending fluid are calculated. We find that even crude meshes give very good volume-averaged results, but fine meshes are required to track local minima and maxima in the stress field. For simple cubic arrays of spheres, the boundary-element results are in excellent agreement with the analytical viscosity predictions of Nunan & Keller (1984). Even at the highest concentration of solids studied, no significant normal stress differences were observed, in agreement with Nunan & Keller's results (1984). Up to moderate concentrations of particles, the volume-averaged properties of the suspension display only a weak dependence on the particle geometry. Suspensions of spheroids and cubes behave approximately as suspensions of spheres on the average despite large differences in the local micromechanics of stress and velocity fields. Simple cubic arrays of clusters of spheres tend to behave on a macroscopic level as a cubic array of spheres whose effective volume fraction is about 150% of the total volume fraction of the spheres in the clusters. {\textcopyright} 1991, Cambridge University Press.

 abstract = {A nonstandard wave equation, established by Galbrun in 1931, is used to study sound propagation in nonuniform flows. Galbrun's equation describes exactly the same physical phenomenon as the linearized Euler's equations (LEE) but is derived from an Eulerian-Lagrangian description and written only in term of the Lagrangian perturbation of the displacement. This equation has interesting properties and may be a good alternative to the LEE: only acoustic displacement is involved (even in nonhomentropic cases), it provides exact expressions of acoustic intensity and energy, and boundary conditions are easily expressed because acoustic displacement whose normal component is continuous appears explicitly. In this paper, Galbrun's equation is solved using a finite element method in the axisymmetric case. With standard finite elements, the direct displacement-based variational formulation gives some corrupted results. Instead, a mixed finite element satisfying the inf-sup condition is proposed to avoid this problem. A first set of results is compared with semianalytical solutions for a straight duct containing a sheared flow (obtained from Pridmore-Brown's equation). A second set of results concerns a more complex duct geometry with a potential flow and is compared to results obtained from a multiple-scale method (which is an adaptation for the incompressible case of Rienstra's recent work).},

The method is based on writing one set of governing equations for the whole computational domain and treating the different phases as one fluid with variable material properties. Interfacial terms are accounted for by adding the appropriate sources as $\delta$ functions at the boundary separating the phases. The unsteady Navier-Stokes equations are solved by a conventional finite volume method on a fixed, structured grid and the interface, or front, is tracked explicitly by connected marker points. Interfacial source terms such as surface tension are computed on the front and transferred to the fixed grid. Advection of fluid properties such as density is done by following the motion of the front. The method has been implemented for fully three-dimensional flows, as well as for two-dimensional and axisymmetric ones. First, the method is described for the flow of two or more isothermal phases. The representation of the moving interface and its dynamic restructuring, as well as the transfer of information between the moving front and the fixed grid, are discussed.

For a plate with initial submergence d starting abruptly from rest to constant horizontal velocity U, the problem is governed by a single parameter, the Froude number Fn = U/(gd)½, where g is the gravitational acceleration. Depending on Fn, three classes of interaction dynamics (subcritical, transcritical and supercritical) are identified. For subcritical Fn (≲ 0.7), the free surface plunges on both the forward and lee sides of the plate before significant interactions with the vortex sheet occur. For transcritical and supercritical Fn, interactions between the free surface and the starting vortex result in a stretching of the vortex sheet which eventually rolls up into double-branched spirals as a result of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. In the transcritical range (Fn ∼ 0.7-1.0), the effect of the free surface on the double-branched spirals remains weak, while for supercritical Fn (≳ 1.0), strong interactions lead to entrainment of the double-branched spiral into the free surface resulting in prominent surface features. {\textcopyright} 1993, Cambridge University Press.

The importance and proper treatment of viscous free-surface conditions for these problems are emphasized.

Nonlinear viscous free-surface flow computations are relatively new. Many of the difficulties such as large Reynolds numbers computations are common to flows without a free surface.

 abstract = {Estimation of the wave height transformation of shoaling and breaking is essential for the nearshore hydrodynamics and the design of coastal structures. Many empirical formulas have been well recognized to the wave height transformation, but most of them were only applicable for gentle slopes. This paper reports the experimental results of wave shoaling and breaking over the steep slopes to examine the applicability of the previous empirical formulas. Two steep bottom slopes of 1/3 and 1/5, and one gentle slope of 1/10 were conducted in the present experiments. Experimental results show that the shoaling distance of steep slopes become short and the surface waves may be partially reflected from the steep bottom, thus the estimation of wave shoaling using the well-known previous formula did not conform completely to the experimental results. The previous empirical formulas for the wave breaking criteria were also examined, and the modified equations to the steep beaches were proposed in this work. A numerical model was finally adopted to calculate the wave height transformation in the surf zone by introducing the modified breaking index. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {This paper reports experimental results of the toe scour of seawall on a steep seabed with slope of 1:5 under the action of breaking waves. The equilibrium toe scour profiles were investigated and the depths of toe scours related to the wave parameters were analyzed. Experimental results indicated that the depth of toe scour increased as the steepness of the incoming wave increased, but decreased with an increase in the water depth at the toe. The breaker types in front of the seawall were investigated. The scour depth due to a plunging breaker is larger than that of a spilling breaker or a nonbreaking wave in front of the seawall. The down-rush flow velocity induced from the wave rundown on the seawall was also investigated in the experiment, and it was found that the scour depth increased as the flow velocity at the toe increased. Empirical formulas of the relative scour depth in terms of the relative toe water depth or surf similarity parameter were obtained based on the experimental results.},

 abstract = {We report a theoretical derivation, an experimental observation and a numerical validation of nonlinear phase domain walls in weakly nonlinear deep water surface gravity waves. The domain walls presented are connecting homogeneous zones of weakly nonlinear plane Stokes waves of identical amplitude and wave vector but differences in phase. By exploiting symmetry transformations within the framework of the nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation we demonstrate the existence of exact analytical solutions representing such domain walls in the weakly nonlinear limit. The walls are in general oblique to the direction of the wave vector and stationary in moving reference frames. Experimental and numerical studies confirm and visualize the findings. Our present results demonstrate that nonlinear domain walls do exist in the weakly nonlinear regime of general systems exhibiting dispersive waves.},

 abstract = {This paper examines two key features of time-dependent conformal map-pings in doubly-connected regions, the evolution of the conformal modulus Q(t) and the boundary transformation generalizing the Hilbert transform. It also applies the theory to an unsteady free surface flow. Focusing on inviscid, incompressible, irrota-tional fluid sloshing in a rectangular vessel, it is shown that the explicit calculation of the conformal modulus is essential to correctly predict features of the flow. Results are also presented for fully dynamic simulations which use a time-dependent con-formal mapping and the Garrick generalization of the Hilbert transform to map the physical domain to a time-dependent rectangle in the computational domain. The results of this new approach are compared to the complementary numerical scheme of Frandsen (J. Comput. Phys. 196:53–87, 2004) and it is shown that correct calcula-tion of the conformal modulus is essential in order to obtain agreement between the two methods.},

The flow is assumed incompressible, inviscid, irrotational and two-dimensional. It obeys a zero-potential condition at the horizontal free surface. This problem of impulsive Green functions is solved for various bottom topographies, such as sloping beaches, submerged ridges, and finite basins.

 abstract = {In this work a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian technique is devised, hereinafter abbreviated as ELAFINT (Eulerian-Lagrangian Algorithm For INterface Tracking). The method is capable of handling fluid flows in the presence of both irregularly shaped solid boundaries and moving/free phase boundaries. The position and shape of the boundary are tracked explicitly by the Lagrangian translation of marker particles. The field equations are solved on an underlying fixed grid as in Eulerian methods. The interface passes through the grid lay-out and details regarding the treatment of the cut cells so formed are provided. The issues involved in treating the internal boundaries are dealt with, with particular attention to conservation and consistency in the vicinity of the interface. The method is tested by comparing with solutions from well-tested body-fitted co-ordinate methods. Test cases pertaining to forced and natural convection in irregular geometries and moving phase boundaries with melt convection are presented. The capability developed here can be beneficial in solving difficult flow problems involving moving and geometrically complex boundaries. {\textcopyright}1996 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {Roughly a third of the nation's population lives in coastal counties. Several million of those live at elevations that could be flooded by rising seas this century, scientific projections show. These cities and towns— home to tourist destinations, fisheries, natural landscapes, military bases, financial centers, and beaches and boardwalks— face a growing risk from sea level rise. The choices we make today are critical to protecting coastal communities. While it will be necessary to adapt to rising seas by, for example, making buildings and infrastructure more resilient, reducing our heat-trapping emissions is one of the best ways to limit the magnitude and pace of sea level rise over the long term. From the rocky shoreline of Maine to the busy trading port of New Orleans, from historic Golden Gate Park in San Francisco to the golden sands of Miami Beach, our coasts are an integral part of American life. Where the sea meets land sit some of our most densely populated cities, most popular tourist destinations, bountiful fisheries, unique natural landscapes, strategic military bases, financial centers, and beaches and boardwalks where memories are created. Yet many of these iconic places face a growing risk from sea level rise. Global sea level is rising—and at an accelerating rate—largely in response to global warming. The global average rise has been about eight inches since the Industrial Revolution. However, many U.S. cities have seen much higher increases in sea level (NOAA 2012a; NOAA 2012b). Portions of the East and Gulf coasts have faced some of the world's fastest rates of sea level rise (NOAA 2012b). These trends have contributed to loss of life, billions of dollars in damage to coastal property and infrastructure, massive taxpayer funding for recovery and rebuild-ing, and degradation of our prized shores. Scientific projections show that global sea level will continue to rise over the course of this century, transforming our coasts. Meeting the challenge of rising seas and coastal storm surges will require immense efforts to build the resilience of our treasured coastal communities. We also need to make ambitious cuts in our heat-trapping emissions, to slow the pace and magnitude of change in sea level and gain time to plan and prepare for its effects. Sea level rise, combined with worsening storm surge, threatens to harm people, property, and ecosystems in coastal communities around the country.},

 abstract = {A method to simulate unsteady multi-fluid flows in which a sharp interface or a front separates incompressible fluids of different density and viscosity is described. The flow field is discretized by a conservative finite difference approximation on a stationary grid, and the interface is explicitly represented by a separate, unstructured grid that moves through the stationary grid. Since the interface deforms continuously, it is necessary to restructure its grid as the calculations proceed. In addition to keeping the density and viscosity stratification sharp, the tracked interface provides a natural way to include surface tension effects. Both two- and three-dimensional, full numerical simulations of bubble motion are presented. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

This system is overdetermined. By changing the sought-for functions, the problem is reduced to a homogeneous one. The resulting system is solved by consecutively solving two boundary value problems: a Stokes problem for one velocity and the pressure and an overdetermined system for the other velocity. Generalized statements of these problems and their discrete approximations using a finite element method are presented. A new regularization method is used to solve the overdetermined problem.},

The cylinder intersects the mean free surface at right angles, and the fluid is bounded below by a fixed horizontal plane. Let the corresponding two-dimensional velocity potential be expressed as a distribution of simple wave sources over the boundary of the body. Then it is known that the source density satisfies a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind which has a unique solution except at those frequencies (the irregular frequencies) at which the Fredholm determinant vanishes. The present work is concerned with the irregular frequencies. Let the simple wave sources be replaced by a fundamental solution which consists of a simple wave source together with additional wave singularities inside the cylinder. It is shown how irregular frequencies can be eliminated by an appropriate choice of these singularities.},

One is a pure BEM approach used in homogeneous domains where the permeability remains constant in the space; the other one is a Dual reciprocity boundary element method (DR-BEM) approach employed in non-homogeneous domains where the permeability changes as a known function. Five cases are briefly discussed: the first two cases deal with a homogeneous domain and piecewise constant pressure and constant flow regimes; the third case considers gravitational effects in a constant pressure injection conducted in a homogeneous domain; the last two cases deal with constant pressure and constant flow injections in a non-homogeneous domain where the permeability changes in radial form. The accuracy of the BEM approaches is evaluated by comparing the numerical results obtained in the simulations with analytical, experimental and numerical results of other authors. In addition to the accuracy assessment of the approaches implemented, in the present research, both flow regimes for the same homogeneous domain are compared and the influence of the change of the fiber volume fraction presented in the non-homogeneous domain is analyzed on the behavior of the radial pressure profile.},

The methodology is presented through a case study in which the wave energy conversion technology and the location selected correspond to the Seawave Slot-Cone Generator (SSG) and a coastal strip in Galicia (NW Spain), respectively. This region represents one of the European areas with the greatest wave energy resource and where pilot plants for wave energy conversion are still undeveloped. To carry out the assessment, we consider the wave data recorded at an offshore buoy and the power matrix of the SSG. The wave conditions offshore-representing the 90% of the total energy for an average year-are propagated through a third generation wave model toward the coast. On the basis of the results, five hotspots or areas with high wave energy levels are highlighted. After crossing the power matrix of the WEC with the wave conditions, we map the expected energy production and the percentage of the total energy captured along the coastline. Among the five hot spots in the area, one is proposed as the optimum for the SSG location. Finally, we discuss the energy supply capacity of the WEC to satisfy the energy consumption needs of nearby communities. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Vennell2010,
 abstract = {Proudman resonance amplifies the oceanic forced wave beneath moving atmospheric pressure disturbances. The amplification varies with water depth; consequently, the forced wave beneath a disturbance crossing topography radiates transient free waves. Transients are shown to magnify the effects of Proudman resonance for disturbances crossing the coast or shelf at particular angles. A Snell like reflection law gives rise to a type of resonance for relatively slow moving disturbances crossing a coast in an otherwise flat-bottomed ocean. This occurs for translation speeds less than the shallow water wave speed for disturbances approaching the coast at a critical angle given by the inverse sine of the Froude number of the disturbance. A disturbance crossing the shelf at particular angles can also excite seiche modes of the shelf via generation of a transient at the continental slope. Beyond a typically small angle of incidence, transients generated by a disturbance crossing the continental slope and coast will be trapped on the shelf by internal reflection. The refraction law for a fast-moving forced wave crossing an ocean ridge at greater than a small angle of incidence also results in trapped free-wave transients with tsunami-like periods propagating along the ridge. The subcritical resonance, excitation of shelf modes and trapping of the transients may have implications for storm surges and the generation of destructive meteotsunami.},

 abstract = {Sardinia (Italy) is the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea and its economy is penalized by high costs of electricity, which is double compared to the continental Italian regions, and triple compared to the EU average. In this research, the wave energy potential of the north-west of Sardinia has been studied by an analysis of wave measurements carried out in a 20-year period by the Italian Wave Buoys Network (1989–2009) and the corresponding hindcast data by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The annual offshore wave power was found to range between 8.91 kW/m and 10.29 kW/m, the bulk of which is provided by north-westerly waves. The nearshore energetic patterns have been studied by means of a numerical coastal propagation model (Mike21 NSW). The analyses highlight two “hot spots” where the wave power is respectively 9.95 and 10.91 kW/m. For these locations, a Wave Energy Converter with maximum efficiency in the ranges of significant wave heights between 3.5 and 4.5 m (energy periods 9.5–11 s) and 4–6 m (energy periods 9.5–11.5 s) respectively should be selected. In order to find a concrete solution to the problem of harvesting wave energy in this area, the characterization of waves providing energy is considered along with additional considerations, such as installation and operational costs, institutional factors, environmental sensitivity and interferences with others human activities. On the basis of the information available and the identified circumstances, the site of Bosa Marina has been proposed as a prospective wave farm location. For this site in particular, multifunctional structures like harbour or coastal protection breakwaters equipped with a WEC are recommended.},

The first, dealing with the fundamentals of Hydraulics, is based on the elementary principles of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. The specific laws governing a system of macroscopic particles are built, then the large systems involving dissipative processes are explained. The continua are then discussed; lastly, a fairly exhaustive account of turbulence is given. The second part discloses the bases of the SPH Lagrangian numerical method from the continuous equations, as well as from discrete variational principles, setting out the method's specific properties of conservativity and invariance. Various numerical schemes are compared, permanently referring to physics as dealt with in the first part. Applications to schematic instances are then discussed; ultimately, practical applications to the dimensioning of coastal and fluvial structures are considered. Despite the rapid growth in the SPH field, this book is the first to present this method in a comprehensive way for fluids. It should serve as a rigorous introduction to SPH and a reference for fundamental mathematical fluid dynamics.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES Botulinum toxin has emerged as an effective approach for the management of sialorrhea. This study presents a critical literature review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of botulinum toxin on drooling severity in patients with sialorrhea. DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane databases. REVIEW METHODS The above sources were searched to identify studies examining botulinum toxin for the treatment of sialorrhea. Included studies were randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Excluded studies failed to report quantifiable outcome measures of drooling severity at 4 weeks postintervention. RESULTS Eight studies involving 181 patients (83 placebo; 98 active) were included in the analysis. Botulinum toxin was found to significantly decrease the severity of drooling in patients with sialorrhea (standardized mean difference [SMD], -1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.05 to -1.04; P = .06; I (2) = 48%) when compared with placebo control using random effects models. The effect was significant in both adult (SMD, -1.29; 95% CI, -1.88 to -0.71) and pediatric (SMD, -1.84; 95% CI, -2.67 to -1.00) populations. Both botulinum toxin A (SMD, -1.53; 95% CI, -2.27 to -0.79) and B (SMD, -1.56; 95% CI, -2.32 to -0.79) produced similar effects. Botulinum toxin doses greater than 50 U (SMD, -3.81; 95% CI, -6.19 to -1.43) produced much stronger effects compared with doses less than or equal to 50 U (SMD, -1.32; 95% CI, -2.28 to -0.36). CONCLUSION Botulinum toxin is a clinically effective therapy that improves drooling severity in patients with sialorrhea. Future studies will need to further evaluate the technique and examine dosages required to achieve optimal outcomes.},

For a country that was already uneasy about energy security, the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which caused a nuclear catastrophe in TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, turned this unease into outright anxiety. With the temporary and/or permanent closure of many nuclear reactors Japan has had to replace lost power. Tokyo has had no choice but to secure additional fossil fuels, a strategy that has negatively affected Japan's economy due to rising fuel costs. The increase in Japan's fossil fuel consumption has also caused a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, and affected Tokyo's commitment to Kyoto targets. This paper analyzes the consequences of the 2011 nuclear disaster for Japan's energy security. Recognizing that Japan's future energy policy choices are constrained and path dependent, the paper outlines energy policy recommendations for Japan's government. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Wandres2017,
 abstract = {Incident wave energy flux is responsible for sediment transport and coastal erosion in wave-dominated regions such as the southwestern Australian (SWA) coastal zone. To evaluate future wave climates under increased greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, past studies have forced global wave simulations with wind data sourced from global climate model (GCM) simulations. However, due to the generally coarse spatial resolution of global climate and wave simulations, the effects of changing offshore wave conditions and sea level rise on the nearshore wave climate are still relatively unknown. To address this gap of knowledge, we investigated the projected SWA offshore, shelf, and nearshore wave climate under two potential future greenhouse gas concentration trajectories (representative concentration pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). This was achieved by downscaling an ensemble of global wave simulations, forced with winds from GCMs participating in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5), into two regional domains, using the Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) wave model. The wave climate is modeled for a historical 20-year time slice (1986–2005) and a projected future 20-year time-slice (2081–2100) for both scenarios. Furthermore, we compare these scenarios to the effects of considering sea-level rise (SLR) alone (stationary wave climate), and to the effects of combined SLR and projected wind-wave change. Results indicated that the SWA shelf and nearshore wave climate is more sensitive to changes in offshore mean wave direction than offshore wave heights. Nearshore, wave energy flux was projected to increase by ∼10% in exposed areas and decrease by ∼10% in sheltered areas under both climate scenarios due to a change in wave directions, compared to an overall increase of 2–4% in offshore wave heights. With SLR, the annual mean wave energy flux was projected to increase by up to 20% in shallow water (< 30 m) as a result of decreased wave dissipation. In winter months, the longshore wave energy flux, which is responsible for littoral drift, is expected to increase by up to 39% (62%) under the RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas concentration pathway with SLR. The study highlights the importance of using high-resolution wave simulations to evaluate future regional wave climates, since the coastal wave climate is more responsive to changes in wave direction and sea level than offshore wave heights.},

 abstract = {The nonlinear dynamics of a gas bubble close to an inclined wall is investigated numerically. The fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and the flow irrotational. A time-integration boundary integral method is used to solve the Laplace equation for the velocity potential to calculate the shape and position of the bubble. Improvements to the previous research on this subject have been made in the surface triangulation of the initial spherical bubble, the integration of the influence coefficients, the calculations of the normal vector and tangential velocity vector at a node, the time integration scheme, etc. Comparisons have been carried out between the results of the present three-dimensional model and the results of a validated axis-symmetrical bubble code (Wang et al., 1996a,b, 1998) for axis-symmetrical cases. The comparisons demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the present method. Simulations have been carried out for a gas bubble initiated at 3.0.Rm, 2.0Rm, and 1.0Rm (Rm being defined as the maximum radius of the bubble) from an inclined wall with various buoyancy parameters and wall angles. All the simulations are performed at high resolution and without numerical instabilities occurring nearly up until the re-entrant jet impacts on the opposite bubble surface. The following qualitative features have been observed. When a bubble is initiated at 3.0Rm or more away from an inclined wall, the jet is roughly symmetric; the jet direction is roughly the same as that of the motion of the bubble centroid, which can be approximately predicted by the Kelvin impulse theory. When a bubble is initiated around 2.0Rm from a wall, the jet is obviously asymmetric and inclined upwards; the Kelvin impulse theory can only be used to predict the location where the jetting occurs, but it can no longer be used to predict the jet direction. When a bubble is initiated at 1.0Rm or less near an inclined wall and the buoyancy and Bjerknes attraction are comparable, the jet is roughly in the upward direction.},

 abstract = {The proposed elastic mesh technique (EMT) is a mesh regulation technique, which is based on the assumption that the segments of a mesh are elastic. EMT can be employed in conjunction with the boundary integral method (BIM) for the simulation of three-dimension bubble dynamics in which problems relating to severe mesh distortion as the bubble evolves are a common occurrence. With EMT, the mesh is advanced not by the material velocity, but the optimum shift velocity obtained by minimizing the total elastic energy stored in every segment of the mesh at each time step. In doing so, the prohibitively small time stepping associated with small meshes without EMT in order to maintain numerical stability is mitigated to a large extent. An important feature is that the EMT scheme accords the user the flexibility to implement a non-uniform optimum constitutive relation governing the elastic behavior of mesh segment and which can be further varied with time. Tests were performed for an underwater explosion bubble exhibiting the dynamics of strong jet development with and without EMT for comparison, and the consideration of incorporating EMT as a hybrid system serving as an alternative to the required mesh refinement which is computationally intensive. A full three-dimension simulation of explosion bubble(s) and in the presence of the free surface were further carried out to elucidate the associated flow physics. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This is in contrast to conventional numerical integration methods, which suffer from the numerical boundary layer. Singularities which are mathematical artifacts are shown to vanish when the contour approach and the direct approach methods are applied. Singularities which arise from the physics are dealt with by way of a complex mapping method in the BEM.

 abstract = {An unstructured mixed-Eulerian-Lagrangian model (MEL) is described for the simulation of the nonlinear wave-body interaction, as opposed to the structured model used widely in this field. In present model, the free surface is interpolated accurately using a polynomial scheme coupled with the moving least-squares method, and is triangulated with a local interrogation method coupled with the advancing front method to provide a high quality mesh. A new method is devised to update the free surface intersection with the body, based on the desingularized boundary-integral method. Double desingularized point sources are used for a control point at the intersection, with one inside the body and the other above the free surface, to satisfy both the body and free surface boundary conditions over there. The desingularized point sources are positioned in terms of the element sizes as well as solid angles of the boundary surface, so as to avoid possible overcrowding of the sources at the corners of the surface. Solid angles on the surface are computed analytically using the spherical triangle theory. As an illustration, the algorithm is used to simulate the wave generation for a Wigley hull, which impulsively starts to move at a constant speed on a calm water surface. The anticipated Kelvin ship-wave pattern is well simulated. The wave profiles along the hull agree well with the measured results of Nobeless and McCarthy [Proceedings of the 2nd DTNSRDC Workshop, Maryland, 1983, pp. 5-35]. As compared to a structured approach, the unstructured model reduces the CPU time and memory requirements and, being robust in handling complex geometries, is more versatile in practical applications. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

 abstract = {Interactions between water waves and non-wall-sided cylinders are analyzed based on velocity potential theory with fully nonlinear boundary conditions on the free surface and the body surface. The finite element method (FEM) is adopted together with a 3D mesh generated through an extension of a 2D Delaunay grid on a horizontal plane along the depth. The linear matrix equation for the velocity potential is constructed by imposing the governing equation and boundary conditions through the Galerkin method and is solved through an iterative method. By imposing the gradient of the potential equal to the velocity, the Galerkin method is used again to obtain the velocity field in the fluid domain. Simulations are made for bottom mounted and truncated cylinders with flare in a numerical tank. Periodic waves and wave groups are generated by a piston type wave maker mounted on one end of the tank. Results are obtained for forces, wave profiles and wave runups. Further simulations are made for a cylinder with flare subjected to forced motion in otherwise still open water. Results are provided for surge and heave motion in different amplitudes, and for a body moving in a circular path in the horizontal plane. Comparisons are made in several cases with the results obtained from the second order solution in the time domain.},

Large-time solutions for free-surface elevation are in good agreement with linear steady-state solutions for small applied pressure parameter p0/($\rho$ ga), with $\rho$g being the weight density of the fluid. The ZWR phenomenon predicted by the linear wave theory at certain critical speeds is recovered from these nonlinear solutions.

The stratified flow is modeled based on the incompressible potential flow theory, with the nonlinear boundary conditions at the interface. Boundary integral equations are formulated for the fully nonlinear interfacial wave generated by the hydrofoil. The numerical model results in a set of nonlinear algebra equations, which are solved using the quasi-Newton method. We show that the quasi-Newton method is more efficient than Newton's method, which is often used for solving these types of equations in the literature.

 abstract = {The traditional small-scale marine engineering experiments that are performed under normal gravity fields always encounter one stubborn difficulty related to full-scale prototype models. However, the difficulty can be resolved by centrifuge experiments that can generate hypergravity fields in which the centrifuge acceleration is many times greater than the gravity acceleration. In this study, the generation of solitary waves in hypergravity fields is proposed using solitary wavemaker theory and scaling laws. A series of case simulations are performed under four different gravity fields (1 g, 30 g, 50 g, and 100 g, where g is the gravity acceleration). These cases are presented and discussed in detail to understand and verify the scaling laws and the stability of the solitary wave during its generation and propagation within hypergravity fields. The numerical results show that the waveform and the static pressure field that are obtained during the simulations performed under different gravity fields agree well at the macroscale. Since the velocity field is sensitive to wave attenuation, time lag, fluid viscosity and surface tension, some discrepancies can be found in the velocity field. It should be noted that the fluid viscosity and surface tension have influence on the wave attenuation. However, wave attenuation and time lag can be offset by a well-designed incident wave condition.},

 abstract = {The natural surge and pitch frequencies of semisubmersible offshore wind platforms are typically designed to be below the wave frequencies to avoid direct excitation. However, surge or pitch resonance can be excited by the nonlinear low-frequency loads generated by irregular incident waves. Second-order potential-flow models with added Morison drag have been found to underpredict this low-frequency excitation and response. As part of the OC6 project1, the authors performed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to enable a better understanding of the low-frequency loads and the limitations of lower-fidelity models. The focus of this paper is to set up a computationally cost-effective CFD simulation of a fixed semisubmersible platform to investigate nonlinear differencefrequency loads and establish the corresponding uncertainty in the results. Because of the high computing cost, CFD simulations of irregular waves can be challenging. Instead, simulations were performed with bichromatic waves having a shorter repeat period. A preliminary comparison with quadratic transfer functions from second-order potential-flow theory shows that CFD models consistently predict higher nonlinear wave loads at the difference frequency, likely because of flow separation and viscous drag not accounted for in potential-flow theory.},

 abstract = {In the OC5 and OC62 projects, the authors observed a persistent underprediction of the nonlinear, low-frequency responses of an offshore wind semisubmersible with many mid-fidelity engineering models, including the OpenFAST tool developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Both the low-frequency wave excitation in surge and pitch and the resulting resonance motions were severely underpredicted. In response, we developed several modifications to the OpenFAST model from the OC5/6 projects to improve the predictions of the low-frequency wave loads and responses. All modifications are in the modeling of the viscous drag forces. Efforts were made to provide physical justifications to the changes and to limit the number of additional parameters requiring tuning, so that the modified model can be applied to other floating wind systems. With the proposed modifications, the predictions of the low-frequency surge and pitch wave loads on a fixed floater and the resonance responses of a floating structure are both significantly improved with a single set of model coefficients, which leads to good agreement with the measurements from the OC6 wave-basin experimental campaign.},

 abstract = {This paper presents and discusses the wave climate off the Swedish west coast. It is based on 8 years (1997-2004) of wave data from 13 sites, nearshore and offshore, in the Skagerrak and Kattegat. The data is a product of the WAM and SWAN wave models calibrated at one site by a wave measurement buoy. It is found that the average energy flux is approximately 5.2 kW/m in the offshore Skagerrak, 2.8 kW/m in the nearshore Skagerrak, and 2.4 kW/m in the Kattegat. One of the studied sites, i.e. site 9, is the location of a wave energy research site run by the Centre for Renewable Electric Energy Conversion at Uppsala University. This site has had a wave power plant installed since the spring of 2006, and another seven are planned to be installed during 2008. Wave energy as a renewable energy source was the driving interest that led to this study and the results are briefly discussed from this perspective. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Underwater Undulatory Swimming (UUS) is an area of continuing development in elite swimming. The propulsive forces generated during UUS are investigated experimentally, during an over-speed tow, and numerically using Elongated Body Theory (EBT), developed initially for fish locomotion. Two-dimensional kinematic motion data (foot, shank, thigh, torso, upper arm, lower arm, and hand) at 25Hz in the sagittal plane is acquired by manual digitisation of video recorded from a stationary camera during an over-speed active tow and input into an EBT model. Thrust (T) determined from EBT and a semi-empirical passive resistance (R) is used to estimate R-T for comparison with the experimental tow line measurement. The forces predicted from EBT although significantly larger than the experimental measurement indicate that the EBT has the potential, with suitable refinement, to provide detailed insight into the hydrodynamics of UUS. Areas for further refinement are in the use of a three-dimensional correction and that higher resolution motion data for the feet are required. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study, a numerical code based on Nwogu's equations is developed. The model uses a fourth-order predictor-corrector method to advance in time, and discretizes first-order spatial derivatives to fourth-order accuracy, thus reducing all truncation errors to a level smaller than the dispersive terms retained by the model. The basic numerical scheme and associated boundary conditions are described. The model is applied to several examples of wave propagation in variable depth, and computed solutions are compared with experimental data. These initial results indicate that the model is capable of simulating wave transformation from relatively deep water to shallow water, giving accurate predictions of the height and shape of shoaled waves in both regular and ...},

This study aims to develop a grade classification map of the global ocean wind energy resource based on CCMP (cross-calibrated, multi-platform) wind field data for the period 1988–2011. We also calculate, for the first time, the total storage and effective storage of wind energy across the global ocean on a 0.251 {\^{A}} 0.251 grid. An optimistic increasing long-term trend in wind power density was found. In addition, the global ocean wind energy resource was analyzed and regionalized by considering the temporal and spatial distributions of wind power density, wind energy levels, and effective wind speed, as well as through a consideration of wind energy storage and the stability and long-term trends of wind power density. This research fills a gap in our knowledge in this field, and provides a reference point for future scientific research and development into wind energy resources such as wind power generation, water pumping, and wind-heating.},

 abstract = {A B S T R A C T Against a backdrop of increasing energy demand, the development of wave energy technology is a logical means of both meeting this demand and mitigating the environmental degradation associated with conventional power generation. Previous research has made considerable progress in the climatic characterization and short-term forecasting of wave energy. However, medium-to long-term predictions of wave energy resources, which are central to the development of future operating and trading strategies, remain scarce. This study provides an overview of long-term climatic trends and medium-to long-term predictions of wave energy, before discussing the focus of future predictions. Finally, a new method is proposed for predicting wave energy resources on a medium-to long-term basis that incorporates the swell index and propagation characteristics of swell energy. This model was developed with the aim of improving the precision of wave energy predictions, thereby providing a reference for the effective utilization of wave resources. The results of this study demonstrate that long-term climatic trend analysis should include not only variations in wave power density (WPD), but also long-term variability in wave energy stability, energy level occurrence, and variability in the occurrence of effective significant wave height (SWH). The medium-to long-term prediction of wave energy should also synthetically consider the above factors. We conclude that monitoring the propagation of swell energy and calculating the swell index constitutes a robust theoretical basis for predicting the WPD of mixed wave.},

 abstract = {In this research, we compared the anatomy and biomechanics of two species of mudskipper vs an aquatic sandgoby in view of terrestrial locomotion. Of particular interest was the relationship (if any) of pectoral fin movement with pelvic fin movement. We show that the pelvic fins of the terrestrial mudskippers studied herein, are retractable and move antagonistically with the pectoral fins. The pelvic fin of the sandgoby studied here is contrarily non-retractable and drags on any underlying substrate that the sandgoby tries to crawl across. We find that the pelvic and pectoral fin muscles of all fish are separated, but that the pectoral fins of the mudskipper species have bulkier radial muscles than the sandgoby. By coupling a detailed morphological investigation of pectoral-pelvic fins musculature with finite element simulations, we find that unlike sandgobies, the mudskipper species are able to mechanically push the pelvic fins downward as pectoral fins retract. This allows for an instant movement of pelvic fins during the pectoral fin backward stroke and as such the pelvic fins stabilize mudskippers through Stefan attachment of their pelvic fins. This mechanism seems to be efficient and energy saving and we hypothesize that the piston-like action might benefit pelvic-pectoral fin antagonism by facilitating a mechanical down-thrust. Our research on the biomechanics of tree-climbing fish provides ideas and greater potential for the development of energetically more efficient systems of ambulation in biomimetic robots.},

While periodic traveling waves are known to approach Stokes' sharply crested extreme wave in an asymptotically self-similar manner, standing waves do not appear to approach Penney and Price's conjectured limiting solution with 90 degree crest angles. Instead, a variety of oscillatory structures form near the crest tip, causing the bifurcation curve to fragment into disjoint branches. In many cases, a vertical jet of fluid pushes these structures upward, leading to wave profiles commonly seen in wave tank experiments. Thus, we observe a rich array of dynamic behavior at small length scales in a regime previously thought to be self-similar.},

As a starting guess, we superpose two Stokes waves offset by half the spatial period. Using an overdetermined shooting method, the background radiation generated by collisions of the Stokes waves is tuned to be identical before and after each collision. In some cases, the radiation is effectively eliminated in this procedure, yielding smooth soliton-like solutions that interact elastically forever. We find examples in which the larger wave subsumes the smaller wave each time they collide, and others in which the trailing wave bumps into the leading wave, transferring energy without fully merging. Similarities notwithstanding, these solutions are found quantitatively to lie outside of the Korteweg-de Vries regime. We conclude that quasi-periodic elastic collisions are not unique to integrable model water wave equations when the domain is periodic.},

 abstract = {We apply the adjoint continuation method to construct highly accurate, periodic solutions that are observed to play a critical role in the multi-pulsing transition of mode-locked laser cavities. The method allows for the construction of solution branches and the identification of their bifurcation structure. Supplementing the adjoint continuation method with a computation of the Floquet multipliers allows for explicit determination of the stability of each branch. This method reveals that, when gain is increased, the multi-pulsing transition starts with a Hopf bifurcation, followed by a period-doubling bifurcation, and a saddlenode bifurcation for limit cycles. Finally, the system exhibits chaotic dynamics and transitions to the double-pulse solutions. Although this method is applied specifically to the waveguide array mode-locking model, the multi-pulsing transition is conjectured to be ubiquitous and these results agree with experimental and computational results from other models. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Both ‘partially nonlinear' and fully nonlinear potential flow methods, as well as computational fluid dynamics methods solving the Navier–Stokes equations and smoothed particle hydrodynamics have been used for this purpose and are reviewed here. These more complex methods have been applied primarily to single devices, so array and mooring line interactions are not considered.

Similarly to surface waves, in-ternal waves can travel long distances, ultimately breaking along continental margins. These breaking waves can transport deep ocean water and asso-ciated constituents (nutrients, larvae, and acidic low-oxygen waters) onto the shelf and locally enhance turbulence and mixing, with important ef-fects on nearshore ecosystems. We are only beginning to understand the role internal waves play in shaping nearshore ecosystems. Here, I review the physics of internal waves in shallow waters and identify two common-alities among internal waves in the nearshore: exposure to deep offshore waters and enhanced turbulence and mixing. I relate these phenomena to important ecosystem processes ranging from extreme events to fertilization success to draw general conclusions about the influence of internal waves on ecosystems and the effects of internal waves in a changing climate.},

At each time step two numerical approaches are used. One is based on the boundary element method in the complex plane. The complex potential is assumed to vary linearly within each element and the solution is obtained by imposing the boundary conditions at the nodes of the elements. The other approach is based on the finite element formulation. Triangular elements and linear shape functions are used. The solution is obtained by the Galerkin method. Numerical results are obtained for the wave elevation generated by a vertical wave maker. Results are also provided for a circular cylinder oscillating below the free surface. For these cases the finite element method is found to provide substantially more efficient computations than the boundary element method using equivalent discretizations. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

It is found that the averaged offshore wave power was approximately 13 kW m−1 in the region of interest. Most of the offshore wave energy in the ECS is contributed by the sea states with significant wave heights between 1.5 m and 3.5 m and with wave energy periods between 6 s and 8 s. Seasonal variations are detected in the wave characteristics of significant wave height and wave power. The predominant wave directions are mainly from the II quadrant and the IV quadrant, respectively, in winter and summer, in accordance with the monsoon characteristics in the ECS. Wave heights, periods and power are generally higher in winter and autumn, and weaker in spring and summer; however, extreme values occur in some summer and autumn months due to the extreme conditions caused by typhoons passing over this region. These extreme sea states do not contribute much to the total annual energy, mainly because of their low occurrence, but may bring risks to the wave energy converters.},

A time-marching scheme in Lagrangian aspect is chosen for the specification of boundary conditions on the moving and deforming free surface while a local polynomial collocation method is applied for solving the Laplace equation at each time step. This collocation method is employed because the partial derivatives of the solution are calculated accurately. The trajectory of each free-surface node can thus be predicted precisely due to the accurate estimation of the partial derivatives of velocity potential, which represent components of the velocity vector at that specific node. The numerical model is applied to the simulation of free surface waves by the liquid sloshing in rectangular, square and cylindrical swaying tanks. Fairly good agreements are observed in the comparison of numerical results with experimental data. Because the partial derivatives of the velocity components are accurately calculated, the pressure distribution in the domain can also be acquired by solving the pressure Poisson equation separately.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a clump model based on Discrete Element Method. The clump model was more close to the real particle than a spherical particle. Numerical simulations of several tests of dry granular flow impacting a rigid wall flowing in an inclined chute have been achieved. Five clump models with different sphericity have been used in the simulations. By comparing the simulation results with the experimental results of normal force on the rigid wall, a clump model with better sphericity was selected to complete the following numerical simulation analysis and discussion. The calculation results of normal force showed good agreement with the experimental results, which verify the effectiveness of the clump model. Then, total normal force and bending moment of the rigid wall and motion process of the granular flow were further analyzed. Finally, comparison analysis of the numerical simulations using the clump model with different grain composition was obtained. By observing normal force on the rigid wall and distribution of particle size at the front of the rigid wall at the final state, the effect of grain composition on the force of the rigid wall has been revealed. It mainly showed that, with the increase of the particle size, the peak force at the retaining wall also increase. The result can provide a basis for the research of relevant disaster and the design of protective structures.},

We first introduce the rational DMS-spline volume by directly generalizing the previous results related to DMS-splines. How to generate a tetrahedral domain that approximates the shape of the object to be deformed is also introduced in this paper. Unlike the traditional FFD techniques, we manipulate the vertices of the tetrahedral domain to achieve deformation results. Our system demonstrates that RDMS-FFD is powerful and intuitive in geometric modeling. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer.},

 abstract = {Traditionally, annual maximum water levels (AMWLs) data mixed with sea level rise (SLR) effects have been used in probability analysis of extreme values. However, considering that SLR can be described by a regression equation, the deterministic variables of SLR should be separated from the extreme value probability analysis. To account for the SLR impact on the extreme high water level in the Florida coastal waters, frequency analysis of AMWL in Pensacola and Fernandina Stations in Florida coast are investigated in this study. With the data for the past 89 and 100 years, regression equations have been derived to predict the SLR trends in Pensacola and Fernandina stations, respectively. Consider sea level rise is not a random variable, historic AMWLs are modified by removing SLR to provide SLR-removed AMWLs for frequency analysis. By comparison to SLR-removed AMWLs, the GEV (general extreme value) and Xu-Huang distributions are shown to provide reasonable predictions of AMWLs. After frequency analysis of SLR-removed AMWLs, SLR impacts are included by adding the SLR from the SLR regression equation in the future. AMWLs with SLR impacts for any return period up to year 2100, with tables for 100-year AMWLs, are provided to support coastal hazard mitigation planning. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {We develop an efficient high-order boundary-element method with the mixed-Eulerian–Lagrangian approach for the simulation of fully nonlinear three-dimensional wave–wave and wave–body interactions. For illustration, we apply this method to the study of two three-dimensional steep wave problems. (The application to wave–body interactions is addressed in an accompanying paper: Liu, Xue & Yue 2001.) In the first problem, we investigate the dynamics of three-dimensional overturning breaking waves. We obtain detailed kinematics and full quantification of three-dimensional effects upon wave plunging. Systematic simulations show that, compared to two-dimensional waves, three-dimensional waves generally break at higher surface elevations and greater maximum longitudinal accelerations, but with smaller tip velocities and less arched front faces. For the second problem, we study the generation mechanism of steep crescent waves. We show that the development of such waves is a result of three-dimensional (class II) Stokes wave instability. Starting with two-dimensional Stokes waves with small three-dimensional perturbations, we obtain direct simulations of the evolution of both L2 and L3 crescent waves. Our results compare quantitatively well with experimental measurements for all the distinct features and geometric properties of such waves.},

 abstract = {A three-dimensional (3-D) numerical model NEWTANK was developed to study viscous liquid sloshing in a tank with internal baffles of different shapes and arrangements. The numerical technique named virtual boundary force (VBF) method was used to model the internal baffles with complex geometries. Laboratory experiments were conducted for non-linear sloshing in a rectangular tank with and without vertical baffle. The numerical model was validated against the measured data together with other available theoretical solutions and numerical results for liquid sloshing under surge and pitch motions. Liquid sloshing in a 3D prismatic tank with different ring baffle arrangements (e.g., height, width, etc.) were further investigated under near-resonant excitations of surge and pitch motions. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique was used to identify the dominant response frequencies of the liquid system to external excitations. The effects of ring baffles on reducing violent liquid sloshing were investigated and discussed in detail. Finally, a demonstration of liquid sloshing in the tank under six degree-of-freedom (DOF) excitations was presented. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

 abstract = {For the design of floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT), all the load cases need to be calculated by using a coupled model of wind turbine and platform, while the uncoupled approach will help to reduce the number of simulations for the design and optimization of floating offshore wind turbines. In this study, the effects of the wind and wave actions on the tower loading of a FOWT were investigated and an uncoupled approach for the load calculation was proposed and verified by comparing with the result of coupled simulation. First, the effect of elastic platform was considered by tuning the Young's modulus of the tower material when rigid platform model was used in the analysis. The effect of wind and wave actions on the loading of the tower was then investigated. It was found that the difference of the wind load between fixed and floating wind turbines is observed only in the mean component and can be predicted by considering the hydrostatic stiffness of the platform and mooring stiffness. The standard deviation of the fore-aft tower moment increased as the significant wave heights increased when the mean wind speeds and peak wave periods were fixed. This is caused by the increase of the inertia force induced by the pitch and surge motions of the platform and the increase of the fluctuating pitch angle. On the other hand, the standard deviation of the fore-aft tower moment decreased as the peak periods increased when the mean wind speeds and significant wave heights were fixed. The increase of the peak period caused the decrease of the pitch and surge accelerations of the platform and results in the decrease of the inertia force. Finally, the tower loading in extreme sea states during power production was carried out by using the proposed uncoupled approach and the results showed good agreement with those by the coupled approach, and the simulation time was reduced to 1/40.},

In the QALE-FEM method, complex unstructured mesh is generated only once at the beginning of calculation and is moved to conform to the motion of boundaries at other time steps, avoiding the necessity of high cost remeshing. In order to tackle challenges associated with floating bodies, several new numerical techniques are developed in this paper. These include the technique for moving mesh near and on body surfaces, the scheme for estimating the velocities and accelerations of bodies as well as the forces on them, the method for evaluating the fluid velocity on the surface of bodies and the technique for shortening the transient period. Using the developed techniques and methods, various cases associated with the nonlinear interaction between waves and floating bodies are numerically simulated. For some cases, the numerical results are compared with experimental data available in the public domain and good agreement is achieved. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {A highly efficient high-order boundary element method is developed for the numerical simulation of nonlinear wave-wave and wave-body interactions in the context of potential flow. The method is based on the framework of the quadratic boundary element method (QBEM) for the boundary integral equation and uses the pre-corrected fast Fourier transform (PFFT) algorithm to accelerate the evaluation of far-field influences of source and/or normal dipole distributions on boundary elements. The resulting PFFT-QBEM reduces the computational effort of solving the associated boundary-value problem from O(N2∼3) (with the traditional QBEM) to O(N ln N) where N represents the total number of boundary unknowns. Significantly, it allows for reliable computations of nonlinear hydrodynamics useful in ship design and marine applications, which are forbidden with the traditional methods on the presently available computing platforms. The formulation and numerical issues in the development and implementation of the PFFT-QBEM are described in detail. The characteristics of accuracy and efficiency of the PFFT-QBEM for various boundary-value problems are studied and compared to those of the existing accelerated (lower- and higher-order) boundary element methods. To illustrate the usefulness of the PFFT-QBEM, it is applied to solve the initial boundary-value problem in the generation of three-dimensional nonlinear waves by a moving ship hull. The predicted wave profile and resistance on the ship are compared to available experimental measurements with satisfactory agreements. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Therefore a unified governing equation can be established in the entire domain which includes the solid phase and the liquid phase. Then, the radial integration method is applied to transform the domain integrals into the boundary integrals to obtain the integral equation where only boundary integrals are involved. Since the effective heat capacity is dependent on temperature the differential equations obtained by the boundary element method are nonlinear. In order to solve these nonlinear differential equations and to determine the temperature field, the predictor-corrector precise integration method is needed. Finally, the phase change interface positions are obtained by interpolation of the temperature field. Several numerical examples are presented to verify the validity and accuracy of the proposed method.},

In this paper, we review the recent developments of SPH in methodology and applications for modeling complex fluid flows. Specifically, in methodology, some important issues including modified SPH particle approximation schemes for improving discretization accuracy, different particle regularization techniques, and various boundary treatment algorithms for solid boundary, free surface, or multiphase interface are described. More importantly, the SPH method with ideas from the dissipative particle dynamics for complex fluids in macro- or meso-scales is discussed. In applications, different complex fluid flows, including biological flows, microfluidics and droplet dynamics, non-Newtonian fluid flows, free surface flows, multiphase flows, and flows with fluid-structure interaction, are reviewed. Some concluding remarks in SPH modeling of complex fluid flows are provided.},

We use the Kadomtsev-Petviashivili (KP) equation to analyze the evolution and its asymptotic state. Laboratory experiments are performed using the laser induced fluorescent (LIF) technique, and detailed features and amplifications at the wall are measured. We find that proper physical interpretation must be made for the KP solutions when the experimental results are compared with the theory under the assumptions of quasi-two dimensionality and weak nonlinearity. Due to the lack of physical interpretation of the theory, the numerical results were previously thought not in good agreement with the theory. With proper treatment, the KP theory provides an excellent model to predict the present laboratory results as well as the previous numerical results. The theory also indicates that the present laboratory apparatus must be too short to achieve the asymptotic state. The laboratory and numerical results suggest that the maximum of the predicted four-fold amplification would be difficult to be realized in the real-fluid environment. The reality of this amplification remains obscure.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a novel parallel design for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. The Message Passing Interface (MPI), standard for distributed memory programming, is used to parallelize the code as a necessary precursor to future multi–GPU implementation. In the proposed parallelization scheme, the domain decomposition is performed based on both spatial and particle decompositions to reach efficient and well-balanced parallelization. To take the advantage of memory locality, the Peano–Hilbert ordering of the underlaying cells, which allows particles that are spatially close to also be close in memory, is adopted. In our scheme, the dynamic load balancing is performed in three Cartesian dimensions as a feedback system that recognizes the particle imbalance and applies the load balancing accordingly. The incompressible SPH (ISPH) method along with an eddy viscosity turbulence model is solved explicitly in the proposed parallel scheme, rather than the typical weakly compressible or implicit incompressible Poisson formulations. The performance of the code is tested for several test cases including a dam–break problem impacting on a short box. The simulation results for water depth at two locations in the tank and two pressure sensors on the box are compared with experimental data and reasonable agreement is achieved.},

 abstract = {When solving partial differential equations by numerical methods, an automatic mesh generation technique which can accommodate local mesh refinement adaptively is desirable. One efficient technique for producing such meshes in two-dimensional space is to subdivide recursively the domain into quadrants using a quadtree to store and manipulate the mesh information. Here, the quadtree grid generation technique is reviewed and its programming discussed. Three data storage methods are examined. The conversion of the quadtree grid to a triangular finite element mesh is also described, along with methods for fitting the mesh to smooth boundary contours. Results from viscous flow and standing wave simulations are used to illustrate mesh adaptivity about internal and boundary features.},

 abstract = {In tokamak operations, breakdown of plasma is the first step of the plasma build-up. In this paper, we present a combinative investigation of radio frequency (RF)-induced breakdown experiments in QUEST (Q-shu University Experiment with Steady-State Spherical Tokamak) and a one-point model of hydrogen ionization. Experimental results with two different frequencies of 2.45 GHz and 8.2 GHz showed that the clear threshold on connection length, L, existed for breakdown with a negative n-index configuration n ¼ {\`{A}}ðR=B v Þ {\'{A}} ð@B v =@RÞ, where R is the major radius and B v the is vertical magnetic field. In contrast, breakdown was always obtained with positive n-index when changing L. It indicates that a lifetime of an incubated electron plays a significant role in the plasma breakdown. According to one-point model calculation, the experimental threshold of L is well pre-dicted by the lifetime of the incubated electron estimated by employing the loss term along with L. The model calculation also describes the requirement of the minimum electron temperature T e for RF-induced breakdown to realize an avalanche of electrons in the tokamak magnetic structure.

 abstract = {Waves on deep water provide one of the most vivid examples of wave motion found in nature and men have long sought to understand this familiar yet complex phenomenon. It is not surprising, therefore, that the problem of the generation of deep-water waves by a local disturbance was the first hydrodynamic problem to be investigated systematically through the general equations of fluid motion; it was posed as a prize topic by the French Academy in 1816, and solved in the same year by Poisson and Cauchy. The Cauchy-Poisson solution describing the radia­ tion of waves from a local source served as one of the most outstanding examples of mathematics applied to a widely observed physical process. A comprehensive treatise on the general subject of waves on deep water was published by Stokes in 1849. The mathematical techniques introduced therein became the cornerstone for modern theories of linear and nonlinear dispersive waves. It is noteworthy that this pioneering theoretical study was motivated by physical observations (Russell 1844). The continued close coupling between experimental and theoretical efforts is probably most responsible for the widespread interest and significant progress in the subject over the past century. For some, the novelty of the Stokes expansion raised questions of convergence in the mathematical sense (Burnside 1916, Nekrasov 1919, Levi-Civita 1925), while for others (Michell 1893, Wilton 1913, Rayleigh 1917), the existence of finite-amplitude steady periodic waves seemed practically certain, and determining the profiles of very steep waves presented the real challenge. Until recently, the stability of a train of steady periodic deep-water waves, regardless of steepness, remained unquestioned. Thus, the theoretical discovery by Lighthill (1965) using},

 abstract = {Smooth parametric surfaces interpolating triangular meshes are very useful for modeling surfaces of arbitrary topology. Several interpolants based on these kind of surfaces have been developed over the last fifteen years. However, with current 3D acquisition equipments, models are becoming more and more complex. Since previous interpolation methods lack a local refinement property, there is no way to locally adapt the level of detail. In this article, we introduce a hierarchical triangular surface model. The surface is overall tangent plane continuous and is defined parametrically as a piecewise quintic polynomial. It can be adaptively refined while preserving the overall tangent plane continuity. This model enables designers to create a complex smooth surface of arbitarry topology composed of a small number of patches to which details can be added by locally refining the patches until an arbitrary small size is reached. It is implemented as a hierarchical data structure where the top layer describes a coarse, smooth base surface and the lower levels encode the details in local frame coordinates. {\textcopyright} 2005 ACM.},

 abstract = {We study the stability of steady nonlinear waves on the surface of an infinitely deep fluid [1, 2]. In section 1, the equations of hydro-dynamics for an ideal fluid with a free surface are transformed to canonical variables: the shape of the surface $\sim$(r, t) and the hydrody-namic potential $\sim$(r, t) at the surface are expressed in terms of these variables. By introducing canonical variables, we can consider the problem of the stability of surface waves as part of the more general problem of nonlinear waves in media with dispersion [g, 4]. The re-sults of the rest of the paper are also easily applicable to the general case. In section 2, using a method similar to van der Pohi's method, we obtain simplified equations describing nonlinear waves in the small amplitude approximation. These equations are particularly simple if we assume that the wave packet is narrow. The equations have an exact solution which approximates a periodic wave of finiteamplitude. In section 3 we investigate the instability of periodic waves of finite amplitude. Instabilities of two types are found. The first type of in-stability is destructiveinstability, similar to the destructive instability of waves in a plasma [g, 6]. In this type of instability, a pair of waves is simultaneously excited, the sum of the frequencies of which is a multiple of the frequency of the original wave. The most rapid de-structive instability occurs for capillary waves and the slowest for gravitational waves. The second type of instability is the negative-pressure type, which arises because of the dependence of the nonlinear wave velocity on the amplitude; this results in an unbounded increase in the percentage modulation of the wave. This type of instability occurs for nonlinear waves through any media in which the sign of the second derivative in the dispersion law with respect to the wave number (d2$\sim$/dk 2) is different from the sign of the frequency shift due to the nonlinearity. As announced by A. N. Litvak and V. I. Talanov [7], this type of instability was independently observed for nonlinear electromagnetic waves.},

 abstract = {A very simple model based on the three-dimensional desingularized boundary integral method is applied to study the evolution of bubble(s) with or without the presence of solid structures. The choice of the desingularization parameters, which is crucial to the success of the method, is studied in the context of bubble dynamics. With the proper choice of parameters, the new model is far more efficient than previous models with virtually the same level of accuracy being achieved. This is largely attributed to the simplicity of the desingularization method. Furthermore, the new model offers a simple and attractive way for mesh refinement. Although it has limitations in the sense that, with this model the time stepping tends to slow down as two surfaces approach each other, this can be easily rectified by switching over to a direct method so that the two surfaces can be drawn closer as required in the context of jet impact. After this the new model can be reinstated to treat the complicated doubly connected geometry involving toroidal bubbles that would otherwise be very difficult to deal with.},

 abstract = {A three-dimensional model of collapsing bubble with jet formation and impact is presented in this paper. The strong instabilities of the jetting process, impact, and toroidal bubble rebound are dampened by a new smoothing scheme based on least squares, thus enabling a smooth transition from a singly connected bubble to a doubly connected toroidal bubble. A high order of mesh regularity is maintained by a mesh refinement procedure. The circulation of the flow around the gaseous tube of the toroidal bubble is modelled by a generalization of the vortex ring method of Q. X. Wang et al. (Comput. Fluids 25, 607 (1996)). Although our results indicate some differences from previous axisymmetric results in terms of time to impact and fine features of the evolving toroidal bubble profiles, the essential physics associated with the jet impact, such as the circulation around the torus and the rebound of the toroidal bubble, are well captured in the new model. We also present, for the first time, results for fully three-dimensional bubbles in which buoyancy effects lead to oblique jetting. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

 abstract = {Three-dimensional, time-domain, wave-body interactions are studied in this paper for cases with and without forward speed. In the present approach, an exact body boundary condition and linearized free surface boundary conditions are used. By distributing desingularized sources above the calm water surface and using constant-strength panels on the exact submerged body surface, the boundary integral equations are solved numerically at each time step. Once the fluid velocities on the free surface are computed, the free surface elevation and potential are updated by integrating the free surface boundary conditions. After each time step, the body surface and free surface are regrided due to the instantaneous changing submerged body geometry. The desingularized method applied on the free surface produces non-singular kernels in the integral equations by moving the fundamental singularities a small distance outside of the fluid domain. Constant strength panels are used for bodies with any arbitrary shape. Extensive results are presented to validate the efficiency of the present method. These results include the added mass and damping computations for a hemisphere. The calm water wave resistance for a submerged spheroid and a Wigley hull are also presented. AU the computations with forward speed are started from rest and proceed until a steady state is reached. Finally, the time-domain forced motion results for a modified Wigley hull with forward speed are shown and compared with the experiments for both linear computations and body-exact computations.},

 abstract = {The Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of tropical atmospheric intraseasonal variability and a primary source of predictability for global sub-seasonal prediction. Understanding the origin and perpetuation of the MJO has eluded scientists for decades. The present paper starts with a brief review of progresses in theoretical studies of the MJO and a discussion of the essential MJO characteristics that a theory should explain. A general theoretical model framework is then described in an attempt to integrate the major existing theoretical models: the frictionally coupled Kelvin–Rossby wave, the moisture mode, the frictionally coupled dynamic moisture mode, the MJO skeleton, and the gravity wave interference, which are shown to be special cases of the general MJO model. The last part of the present paper focuses on a special form of trio-interaction theory in terms of the general model with a simplified Betts–Miller (B-M) cumulus parameterization scheme. This trio-interaction theory extends the Matsuno–Gill theory by incorporating a trio-interaction among convection, moisture, and wave-boundary layer (BL) dynamics. The model is shown to produce robust large-scale characteristics of the observed MJO, including the coupled Kelvin–Rossby wave structure, slow eastward propagation ($\sim$5 m/s) over warm pool, the planetary (zonal) scale circulation, the BL low-pressure and moisture convergence preceding major convection, and amplification/decay over warm/cold sea surface temperature (SST) regions. The BL moisture convergence feedback plays a central role in coupling equatorial Kelvin and Rossby waves with convective heating, selecting a preferred eastward propagation, and generating instability. The moisture feedback can enhance Rossby wave component, thereby substantially slowing down eastward propagation. With the trio-interaction theory, a number of fundamental issues of MJO dynamics are addressed: why the MJO possesses a mixed Kelvin–Rossby wave structure and how the Kelvin and Rossby waves, which propagate in opposite directions, could couple together with convection and select eastward propagation; what makes the MJO move eastward slowly in the eastern hemisphere, resulting in the 30–60-day periodicity; why MJO amplifies over the warm pool ocean and decays rapidly across the dateline. Limitation and ramifications of the model results to general circulation modeling of MJO are discussed.},

Firstly, a numerical model under the incompressible potential assumption is established for 3D bubble dynamics, and the traditional technique for the vortex ring induced potential at the reference point in axisymmetric model is extended to arbitrary location in 3D model. Then, to homogenize the boundaries' mesh density, new Density Potential Method is put forward inspired by the Elastic Mesh Technique. It's combined together with the topology optimization based on edge swapping procedure to maintain a desirable mesh for the large deformation problem. Through the verification and the comparison by simulating a benchmark case, the improved model demonstrates good accuracy and stability. Particularly, more toroidal bubble evolution detailed features are captured which are in accordance with the axisymmetric model. Finally, bubble dynamics under different circumstances are simulated with the improved 3D numerical model presented in this paper, which shows that the improved model is also robust.},

Resonant swirling waves are observed travelling along the tank sides, when the even sloshing mode is aroused. Then, the tank is excited at half of the first even natural frequency. Techniques of the FFT filter and wavelet analysis are applied to distinct the wave components from the wave elevation histories, through which the occurrence of the secondary resonance is identified. During the secondary resonance, three typical wave motion patterns are observed, i.e. swirling waves, standing waves and double-peak travelling waves. Effects of the excitation amplitude and the liquid depth on the secondary resonance are investigated. Further, the secondary resonance by oscillating the tank at the difference of the first even and first odd natural frequency is studied. The first odd sloshing mode is found to contribute to the dominance of the even mode wave component during the secondary resonance.},

 abstract = {In this study, we investigated the hydrodynamic and energy conversion performance of a double-float wave energy converter (WEC) based on the linear theory of water waves. The generator power take-off (PTO) system is modeled as a combination of a linear viscous damping and a linear spring. Using the frequency domain method, the optimal damping coefficient of the generator PTO system is derived to achieve the optimal conversion efficiency (capture width ratio). Based on the potential flow theory and the higher-order boundary element method (HOBEM), we constructed a three-dimensional model of double-float WEC to study its hydrodynamic performance and response in the time domain. Only the heave motion of the two-body system is considered and a virtual function is introduced to decouple the motions of the floats. The energy conversion character of the double-float WEC is also evaluated. The investigation is carried out over a wide range of incident wave frequency. By analyzing the effects of the incident wave frequency, we derive the PTO's damping coefficient for the double-float WEC's capture width ratio and the relationships between the capture width ratio and the natural frequencies of the lower and upper floats. In addition, it is capable to modify the natural frequencies of the two floats by changing the stiffness coefficients of the PTO and mooring systems. We found that the natural frequencies of the device can directly influence the peak frequency of the capture width, which may provide an important reference for the design of WECs.},

 abstract = {Boundary element method (BEM) with fully nonlinear boundary conditions is developed to simulate the interaction between an incident wave and a freely floating cylinder. The elastic mesh technique (EMT) is adopted to optimize the mesh on free surface in time domain. Auxiliary functions are introduced to decouple the mutual dependence between the motion of cylinder and the fluid force. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for time marching is used. The present method is verified through convergence study and comparison with other method. The motion responses, the hydrodynamic forces as well as the free surface elevation are studied and the resonance phenomenon is analyzed.In the field of ocean engineering, linear or weakly nonlinear potential flow method has been widely developed to study wave-body interaction problems. However in extreme sea condition or larger waves, fully nonlinear method can be used to predict more accurate results. For fully nonlinear time-domain simulation, the Mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian (MEL) method for tracking the free surface was widely used, which was proposed by Longuet-Higgins and Cokelet (1976). They tracked the material-nodes on free surface with kinematic condition in Lagrangian form and the potential was updated in Eulerian form, through which the motion of a two-dimensional floating body was calculated. Since then, MEL was referenced by many researchers to investigate the interaction between waves and bodies. There are mainly two kinds of wave-body interaction problems, of which the former can be summarized as the numerical wave tank, and one side of the tank moves to generate waves. In such cases, side wall effects on the motion responses can not be ignorable (Chen, 1994). The other kind of typical studies on wave-body interaction was proposed by Ferrant et al. (1997, 1998), in which an efficient open water model was established by separating the unknown disturbed wave from the known incident wave. The incident wave can be chosen as any theoretical wave while the disturbed wave can be obtained by solving a definite solution model. Many researchers preferred the open water method for its efficiency and easier application. Zhou et al. (2013) studied the diffraction, the forced vibration and the ringing phenomenon of a floating cylinder by fully nonlinear method in open water, and revealed the nonlinear effects of the hydrodynamic force. Bai et al. (2014) performed a fully nonlinear simulation of the motion responses of a moored cylindrical structure submerged beneath the water. Feng and Bai (2015) simulated the flow behaviors of the parallel double boxes in waves by a fully nonlinear numerical method. Harman et al. (2016) studied the effective loads of a submerged crane ship by fully nonlinear theory. Feng and Bai (2017) investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a multi-body system.},

In some sea conditions, there is a strong coupling between the multi-floating structures that seriously affects the safety of offshore operations. Therefore, the prediction of the relative motion and force between the multi-floating structures and the wave elevation around the multi-floating-system has become a hot issue. At present, the problem of double-floating-system is mostly based on linear potential flow theory. However, when the gap width between two floating bodies is small, the viscous and nonlinear effects are not negligible, so the potential flow theory has great limitations. Based on the viscous flow theory, using the finite difference solution program of FLOW3D and using volume of fluid technology to capture the free surface, a three-dimensional numerical wave basin is established, and the numerical results of the wave are compared with the theoretical solution. On this basis, the hydrodynamic model of side-by-side double-floating-system with a narrow gap is established, and the flow field in the narrow gap of the fixed double-floating-system under the regular wave is analyzed in detail. The law of the gap-resonance is studied, which provides valuable reference for the future research on the multi-floating-system.},

The caudal fin is driven through wire-driven mechanism. The pectoral fins can perform two degrees-of-freedom motions, i.e. flapping (roll) and feathering (pitch). The pectoral fins can move in labriform mode for propulsion, or for other purposes such as turning and diving. Second, the propulsion analysis models for caudal fin propulsion and pectoral fins propulsion are derived. Finally, three types of experiments are conducted. Experiment results show that the swimming speed of caudal fin propulsion and pectoral fin propulsion match the model predictions. Moreover, with the caudal fin propulsion alone, the robot fish can swim up to 0.66 BL/s (body length/second); with the pectoral fin propulsion alone, the robot fish can swim up to 0.26 BL/s.

 abstract = {How to build a biomimetic robot fish has always been a divergent question. Most of the existing robot fishes suffer structural complexity and propulsive inefficiency. In this paper, we proposed a method that transfers the natural actuation properties of fish to the biomimetic robot counterpart. The natural properties were analyzed based on the Lighthill fish swimming model and the actuation function of fish muscles. The analyses shown that the compliant part is feasible in fish propulsion, which means nonactuated/compliant part is also feasible to achieve an effective propulsion on robot fish, and an example of this type of robot fish and its general kinematic model are presented. This transform method not only can demonstrate the actuation features of fish, but also can reduce the motors in building robot fish. The method has also been extended to apply on different swimming modes, offering a general guidance to build efficient biomimetic robot fishes with fewer motors.},

The boundary layer effect and thin body effect are dealt with. The completely analytical integral formulas are suitable for the linear and non-isoparametric quadratic elements. The present algorithm applies the analytical formulas to treat nearly singular integrals. The potentials and fluxes at the interior points very close to boundary are evaluated. The unknown potentials and fluxes at boundary nodes for thin body problems with the thickness-to-length ratios from 1E-1 to 1E-8 are accurately calculated by the present algorithm. Numerical examples on heat conduction demonstrate that the present algorithm can effectively handle nearly singular integrals occurring in boundary layer effect and thin body effect in BEM. Furthermore, the present linear BEM is especially accurate and efficient for the numerical analysis of thin body problems. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Coastal phenomena at river estuary areas will be affected by global climate change conditions. This paper reports on analysis of the sea level rise (SLR) from the last 50 years of tide stations data along the East Asia and Chinese coasts and morphodynamic changes in the Yangtze River Estuary determined for four SLR rates. Long-term tide records of 58 stations from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) database were analyzed to develop projected estimates of the SLR trends. The calculated average rate of SLR is 2.67 mm/yr along the East Asia coasts, and 2.89 mm/yr along the Chinese coasts, with a 5.44 mm/yr estimate at the Yangtze Estuary, which is nearly three times the global average. Including the joint effects of the SLR and coastal land subsidence, the relative SLR will range from 1.5 m to 2.7 m at the Yangtze Estuary by the end of this century. Under the conditions of dry season water discharge, numerical simulation results show that the flood and ebb velocities would decrease for the SLR greater than 0.18 m. The areas of influence will increase proportional to the scale of SLR, significantly changing deposition conditions in this river estuary. Simulation results indicate that more dramatic morphological changes occur in the estuary during the dry conditions as compared to wet conditions. During the wet seasons, significant topography changes occur only for the SLR greater than 0.59 m, with an associated increase in the current velocities outside the river mouth. This may induce severe beach erosion problems, especially along the northern coasts of the Yangtze Estuary. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

On the free surface, a Mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian (MEL) technique is employed in the time marching process, and mesh regridding and interpolation are applied to avoid possible numerical instability. An artificial damping layer is distributed on the outer part of the free surface to prevent wave reflection from the far-field boundary. For the calculation of wave loads, some auxiliary functions are used, instead of directly predicting the time derivative of the velocity potential. The developed model is applied to simulate a truncated vertical circular cylinder undergoing forced heave, surge or pitch motions, respectively. A series of higher-harmonic force components on the cylinder are derived by the Fourier Transformation. The added-mass and radiation-damping coefficients of the cylinder are also obtained from the least-square method. The simulated results are compared with the experimental and numerical results of other researchers.

A fully nonlinear numerical model is developed by using a higher-order boundary element method (HOBEM). In this model, the instantaneous body position and the transient free surface are updated at each time step. A Lagrangian technique is employed as the time marching scheme on the free surface. The mesh regridding and interpolation methods are adopted to deal with the possible numerical instability. Several auxiliary functions are proposed to calculate the wave loads indirectly, instead of directly predicting the temporal derivative of the velocity potential. Numerical experiments are carried out to simulate the heave motions of a submerged sphere in infinite water depth, the heave and pitch motions of a truncated flared cylinder in finite depth. The results are verified against the published numerical results to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed model. Moreover, a series of higher harmonic waves and force components are obtained by the Fourier transformation to investigate the nonlinear effect of oscillation frequency. The difference among fully nonlinear, body-nonlinear and linear results is analyzed. It is found that the nonlinearity due to free surface and body surface has significant influences on the numerical results of the radiated waves and forces.},

 abstract = {Fish adaption behaviors in complex environments are of great importance in improving the performance of underwater vehicles. This work presents a numerical study of the adaption behaviors of self-propelled fish in complex environments by developing a numerical framework of deep learning and immersed boundary–lattice Boltzmann method (IB–LBM). In this framework, the fish swimming in a viscous incompressible flow is simulated with an IB–LBM which is validated by conducting two benchmark problems including a uniform flow over a stationary cylinder and a self-propelled anguilliform swimming in a quiescent flow. Furthermore, a deep recurrent Q-network (DRQN) is incorporated with the IB–LBM to train the fish model to adapt its motion to optimally achieve a specific task, such as prey capture, rheotaxis and K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n gaiting. Compared to existing learning models for fish, this work incorporates the fish position, velocity and acceleration into the state space in the DRQN; and it considers the amplitude and frequency action spaces as well as the historical effects. This framework makes use of the high computational efficiency of the IB–LBM which is of crucial importance for the effective coupling with learning algorithms. Applications of the proposed numerical framework in point-to-point swimming in quiescent flow and position holding both in a uniform stream and a K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortex street demonstrate the strategies used to adapt to different situations.},

@article{Zijlema2005,
 abstract = {Irregular convergence behaviour is frequently encountered when computations of wave spectra are performed by means of the third-generation wind wave model SWAN (Simulating WAve Nearshore). Numerical accuracy is another key issue. The present paper proposes two techniques that improve the convergence and accuracy properties of SWAN in the prediction of stationary wave conditions in the nearshore zone. The first is an under-relaxation approach in which the extent of updates during the iteration process, which underlies a route to steady state, is made proportional to wave frequency. This method complies with the principle of decreasing time scales at higher frequencies, which is inherent to the evolution of wind waves. As a result, the improved SWAN model is free from numerical restrictions to spectral shape in the non-equilibrium range. The second proposed method is a new termination criterion associated with the rate of model convergence, by which the identification of the point of convergence is improved. The capabilities of these methods are demonstrated by simulations of idealized cases and a field application featuring fetch- and depth-limited wave growth. It is concluded that the proposed termination criterion improves numerical accuracy and that the action density limiter, as currently used in SWAN, has minimal negative influence on stationary model results. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {This paper is concerned with the interaction of an internal solitary wave (ISW) at the interface of two-layer fluid and the free surface wave on top of the upper layer. It is based on the potential flow theory since internal waves are associated with large Reynolds numbers. The potential flows in the upper layer and lower layer are modeled using a multi-domain boundary element method (MDBEM). The computational model is validated with the experimental results for the profile and speed of the internal wave. The MDBEM is suitable for the simulation of ISW in both small and large density jump stratified fluid system. The wave velocity is compared with the approximate analytical theory for various ratios of the fluid densities of the two layers. In addition, the amplitude, velocity and profile of the surface wave induced by ISWs are investigated. The free surface displacement is opposite to that of the interface, and the amplitude of the surface wave increases with the amplitude and density jump. The surface wave induced by an ISW can be soliton-like wave, propagating with the constant speed of the ISW and maintaining its profile.},

 abstract = {A time domain model is applied to a three-dimensional point absorber wave energy converter. The dynamical properties of a semi-submerged hemisphere oscillating around a pivot point where the vertical height of this point is above the mean water level are investigated. The numerical model includes the calculation of the non-linear hydrostatic restoring moment by a cubic polynomial function fit to laboratory test results. Moreover, moments due to viscous drag are evaluated on the oscillating hemisphere considering the horizontal and vertical drag force components. The influence on the motions of this non-linear effect is investigated by a simplified formulation proportional to the quadratic velocity. Results from experiments are shown in order to validate the numerical calculations. All the experimental results are in good agreement with the linear potential theory as long as the waves are sufficiently mild i.e. H/$\lambda$≤0.02. For steep waves, H/$\lambda$≥0.04 however, the relative velocities between the body and the waves increase thus requiring inclusion of the non-linear hydrostatic restoring moment to effectively predict the dynamics of the wave energy converter. For operation of the device with a passively damping power take-off the moment due to viscous drag is found to be negligible.},
